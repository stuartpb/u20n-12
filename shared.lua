Dmitry Lyakhov works at the The Institute of Marine Technology Problems. The Institute of Marine Technology Problems is considered to be mostly advanced in the world in the development of autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles (AUV). Along with the fundamental theoretical studies directed to determine principle problems of the underwater robotics, the IMTP performs experimental work for development of the unmanned underwater vehicles intended for utilization in national economy. More than ten AUV types, capable of investigating into sea bottom without man participation, surveying the relief, searching, inspecting the sunken objects and measuring the environmental parameters, have been developed by the institute researchers and engineers and tested at depths up to 6000 m.
