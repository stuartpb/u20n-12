Dr. Bennett spent 20 years with the British Royal Navy carrying out research on underwater blast, inert gas narcosis, oxygen toxicity and decompression sickness. In 1966, he discovered the High Pressure Nervous Syndrome (HPNS) and directed a record 1,500 ft oxygen helium saturation dive in 1970. In 1972, he came to Duke University Medical Center as Professor in the Dept. of Anesthesiology to head the multi-chamber Hyperbaric Center. There he developed further TRIMIX (He/N2/O2) to ameliorate or prevent the HPNS. He directed the 4 deep saturation dives "Atlantis" at Duke with TRIMIX and a record depth of 686m (2,250 ft).

Later in 1983-1986, in Germany, 14 deep TRIMIX saturation dives between 300-600 msw were made by 13 divers with 8 hours welding per day with little or no HPNS.  In 1986-1990, a further 17 more dives were made with 2,662 man days' saturation and 983 welding days' at 450 m.

Dr. Bennett was the Founder and President of the Divers Alert Network from 1980-2003 and is presently Executive Director, Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society. He has published over 200 papers in diving medicine and 8 books, including the textbook, *The Physiology and Medicine of Diving*, now in its 5th edition. Recipient of some 17 international awards, in 1994 he was elected as a foreign member of the 300 year old Russian Academy of Science and an Honorary Member of University of the Mediterranean in Marseille.

Tom brings to the table over 30 years of conservation law enforcement experience with nearly 25 of those in supervision. Tom received recognition for his work above and beyond with the prestigious Shikar Safari International Wildlife Officer of the Year award, the Wisconsin Conservation Congress Officer of the Year Award and several intra-departmental recognitions. It wasn't until about 6 years ago that he found a piece of equipment that improved efficiency and effectiveness of officers across all fields. While conservation law enforcement has always involved water related investigations the subsurface has been largely overlooked. Tom recognized the capabilities of the VideoRay as being an opportunity to venture into the unknown.  As team leader for operations Tom has trained and guided staff in successful missions in body recoveries and cross program integrated work.

Dr. Mahesh Menon is an Electronics and Communications engineer by trade and graduated from University of Wales, Swansea. He then pursued his MSc in Photonics and Communications Systems, also at the same University. He held industrial positions at Ericsson Mobile Communications in Malaysia, devising a more reliable testing rig for mobile phone assemblies and ICN Photonics in Wales, where he designed a system for a hand-held laser device used to treat skin blemishes and remove acne/tattoos. He was offered a PhD scholarship at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where he devised a novel modulation scheme for optical wireless systems, which formed his thesis. Upon graduating, he worked within the Security and Surveillance industry, firstly as a senior engineer designing intelligent camera systems, such as automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras and ANPR systems to mobile speed enforcement systems. Mahesh was then promoted to Engineering Manager, where he was instrumental in designing the mobile security system for the Dubai Police Force and other law enforcement organisations in Algeria, France, Norway and the Netherlands. The systems utilised scene analysis capabilities together with face recognition, all integrated into one global back office application that can be downloaded onto other mobile platforms such as laptops in vehicles and smart phones. Mahesh is now the R&D Manager at SMD, leading the technological innovation and development in subsea vehicle and systems engineering, within the ROVs, Trenching, Mining, Renewables and Nuclear business streams in the company. Although being from an electronics background, Mahesh has a passion in mechanical engineering and enjoys the challenges presented in designing components and systems for the subsea industry.
