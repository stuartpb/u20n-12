This is the directory pages are output to for upload to the site.

It contains 4 different types of files:

- Pages that are generated by versioned scripts, and as such don't need
  to be versoned themselves.
- Blobs that would only bloat the object store if added to versioning (since this directory can more or less be dragged to the server directly, keeping images in this directory locally makes sense).
- Static, non-generated pages, like errata.html (listing the changes between the printing of the paper booklet and the conference) and index.html (explaining the mirror of the site).
- ui2012.css, the stylesheet for all pages on the site.

As such, the only files that aren't ignored in this directory are the
aforementioned CSS file and two static pages, the .gitignore itself, and this README.
