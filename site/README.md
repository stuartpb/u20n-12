This is the directory pages are output to for upload to the site.

It contains 3 different types of files:

- Pages that are generated by versioned scripts, and as such don't need
  to be versoned themselves.
- Blobs that would only bloat the object store if added to versioning.
- ui2012.css

As such, the only files that aren't ignored in this directory are the
aforementioned CSS file, the .gitignore itself, and this README.
