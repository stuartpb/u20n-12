Excavating and recovering ancient artefacts from the seabed demands precise and highly reliable equipment.  Florida-based RPM Nautical Foundation (RPMNF) has pushed the boundaries of maritime archaeology by performing the careful and precise work necessary for professional archaeology at depths beyond effective diver range.

To accomplish these goals, RPMNF uses an ROV fitted with two Hydro-lek multifunctional manipulator arms, most recently in the Egadi Islands off Sicily where they discovered warship rams that date back to the 3rd century BC.

This paper will provide an overview of how these Hydro-Lek manipulators were utilized in the recovery of not just these important archaeological artefacts but also in many other deep sea salvage operations.  It will also explain the design and operation of the hydraulic manipulator technology and how smaller ROV's can be empowered by the use of high performance subsea tooling.

Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) fill different niches within the underwater intervention task spectrum.  AUVs provide the capability for subsea inspection and survey on a variety of range scales and with multiple sensors, including sidescan and synthetic aperture sonar, sub-bottom profiling, multi-beam echosounding and still and video photography.  Small ROVs can provide inspection, repair and maintenance capabilities to assist the oil and gas industries in deep water environments.
Bluefin Robotics recently acquired the assets of Hawkes Remotes, Inc. (HRI), a spinoff from Hawkes Ocean Technologies (HOT) that develops advanced ROVs.  The HRI designs offer scalable, modular solutions including a thin, armored fiber-optic tether and on-board high-energy-density batteries that will reduce the total cost of ownership/operating costs while simultaneously outperforming existing ROV technology.  Bluefin will leverage their autonomy and subsea experience to add hybrid capabilities to the ROVs and offer them as an extension of their current product line to the oil and gas industry.  The presentation will show how the Bluefin/Hawkes capabilities in the AUV and ROV space provide complementary technologies that will enable a wide variety of underwater intervention tasks with a cost-effective footprint and low infrastructure support.

This subject will address a recent accident that occured to a diver while performing an underwater welding operation.  The resulting investigation and root cause analysis lead to the identification of several unrealized conditions that aided in creating this "perfect storm."  These included such items as unaccounted power sources, unfamiliar with tools, unknown actual amperage from welder, and adjacent work groups.  The end result was a new, and more detailed JHA was created that addresses these hazards.  This JHA includes all of the best safet practices as laid out by the ADCI, but also takes it to the next level of pre-job set ups, and a firm commitment by AEP on how all U/W buring and welding work will conducted across the entire fleet.

The concept of ROV subsea inertial navigation and ROV mounted Multibeam has been around for a number of years. In a recent offshore project the two systems were tightly integrated so the inertial system provided Heading, pitch, roll and position directly to the Multibeam. The paper discusses the integration processes – good parts and bad. In the results errors in the system are shown and how they were resolved. Also demonstrates the 2 way LBL and inertial for ROV navigation. The paper gives real project result from the Gulf of Mexico with some spectacular images.

This presentation will trace the development and use of two manned submersibles on budgets that are a fraction of other vehicles with similar capabilities.  The first one of these was began in 1989 and named C-BUG (Controlled by Buoyancy Underwater Glider). It was one of the first winged subs ever made and enjoyed a successful career spanning over 550 dives in three countries. The next vehicle was named Idabel, and despite an initial budget of under 100k it has made over 900 dives to depths of up to half a mile.   In addition to keeping manufacturing costs low, operating costs have been kept low as well by a location choice that offers immediate access to deep water without the need for a support craft of any sort. A third aspect to the low operating costs has been the engineering of Idabel for minimum displacement. This craft carries two passengers and a pilot and weighs in at just over 9,000 pounds, making it not only less expensive to build and operate, but giving it a distinct advantage for photography. This formula has resulted in dive rates that start at just $400 per person for a 1000 foot dive, and a day rate of $2,000 for up to 6 hour-long dives.

In this talk we present a comprehensive survey procedure developed in-house and deployed on a recent survey mission in Mount Hope Bay to locate two ship wreckages using an Iver2. The vehicles were equipped with a Klein Side Scan Sonar, an Imagenex Delta-T multi-beam sensor and a Sontec Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) sensor. We present details on the in water compass calibration procedure that was developed using an Extended Kalman Filtering approach.   In addition, details on mission specification, localization including slant range correction and logging of multi-beam and side-scan sonar data are also presented. The multi-beam and side-scan data are prost-processed for automatic as well as manual artifact identification. Some sample results are also presented. We envision this comprehensive approach to be adopted for  multiple applications such as SLAM, hydrographic survey and underwater inspection missions.

The capabilities of the Triton XLX Heavy Work Class ROV have been well proven since introduction to the Offshore Industry five years ago.  Reliability, adaptability, load carrying capacity and volume for equipment and tool deployment, are the solid foundations on which the system is based.  Coupled with a state of the art control system, the ROV has become a formidable tool in the contractor's armoury, with over 70 systems built.
New developments in equipment and control such as HD cameras, LED lighting and DVL auto-position have been gradually introduced to meet the ever increasing demands of operators.  The innovative PSS Type 4 and Type 5 TMS have further enhanced the ROV system, providing large tether storage capacity in compact lightweight units.
Building on this success, the new Generation 2 vehicles now offer increasing operator control throughout the water column, with the ROVDP multi-sensor control system which includes full capability for auto waypoint control, remote mission navigation and auto pipe and cable following functions.  Additionally increased vehicle on board power, with true 200 shaft hp systems, that feature enhanced tooling hydraulic capacity, with full flow proportional take offs, add to the vehicle capabilities.  4160V power systems allow optimisation of umbilical to 4000m water depths.  These ROVs are complemented by a wide range of stainless steel TMS and garage options, from small systems carrying 450m of tether, up to the most recent Type 6 TMS development that gives large excursions up to 1500m.
The these innovative features and the benefits to the operator that they bring, are presented.

This presentation will be divided in two parts.  The first part will be a brief history of the use of semi-submersible vessels for drug trafficking, beginning with the 2006 seizure of the first confirmed semi-submersible and concluding with the seizures of two fully submersible vessels in 2010.  I will provide technical specifications of those seized as well as the drug trafficking organization requirements for a submersible to be a viable method of delivery.

The second part of the presentation will be the implications of the suspected use of submersibles by drug traffickers for the submersible community.  This will include the perception of submersibles by the law enforcement community, the potential of misidentification of a legally operated submersible as a threat, and the necessity of standard operating procedures by legitimate submersible operators to help avoid this misidentification.

I will use examples of both submersible and surface vessel operations, as well as other examples from various transportation sectors.  These examples will clarify how other industries help to separate legitimate from illegitimate operators to ensure both their economic and physical survival.
