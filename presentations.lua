American Electric Power, a Sustaining Member of ADCI, continues to conduct training of its employees in the rules and regulations of commercial diving via OSHA, US Coast Guard and the ADCI Consensus Standards.  Training programs are conducted each year at selected AEP facilities for new students and re-qualifying Diving Contacts.  Criteria for becoming a Diving Contact at AEP is delineated in their program and requires each person to be nominated by management, complete the program and a written examination.  They serve in the program for a period of three years and must re-qualify by attending refresher training.  An AEP Diving Contact works directly with diving contractors at any AEP facility.  They are familiar with all diving regulations and the Consensus Standards, including Rev. 6, and can work the diving tables for repetitive dives, surface decompression on air or oxygen for example. Since they understand parts of our industry; they really make it easier for a diving contractor to communicate with them.  Dave Scarberry has been their Diving Coordinator and the originator of their program since inception and is responsible for its development and administration.  Will Hux is the instructor from MESCO/ Stroud Diving & Hydrography and wrote the training curriculum for the classroom portion of the training.  They make a strong team in presenting a safety program of which is an industry first.

HUGIN and REMUS AUVs use advanced feature recognition algorithms, developed originally for mine-detection, to track subsea pipelines directly in sonar data in real time. This, combined with sensors such as multibeam echo sounder and high-resolution still camera, enables inspection of pipelines at a considerably higher speed, and thus lower cost, than traditional methods, while producing higher quality data. Kongsberg Maritime’s unique way of performing pipeline inspection with AUV involves two fully-autonomous passes along a pipeline. The first pass is run off to the side, and by using either high-resolution interferometric synthetic aperture sonar (HISAS) or conventional side scan sonar (SSS), a wide swath around the pipeline is mapped as the AUV automatically tracks the pipeline directly from the sonar data. This way, the pipeline’s actual position is determined and knowledge is gained about surrounding threats like anchors and trawling activity in a wide swath of up more than 200 meters.
The second pass is run directly over the pipeline at a low altitude, and accurate inspection data is collected with multibeam echo sounder and camera. By using high-resolution still camera and mosaic techniques, one avoids the massive over-sampling resulting from use of video-cameras, which makes data management easier. The still camera pictures are automatically and accurately geo-referenced in the AUV, removing the need for the time-consuming task of matching up video with ROV positioning data. Another significant cost reduction stems from the elimination of the support vessel normally used in traditional pipeline inspection with ROV.
In cases where a priori data about the pipeline’s position is poor, and where the pipeline may be partially buried, this concept exploits the wide swath afforded by the HISAS by increasing tracking robustness and reducing the need for lateral search patterns to reacquire partially buried pipelines.
In the fall of 2011, Kongsberg Maritime has integrated automatic tracking of pipelines directly from the multibeam echo sounder data, thereby adding an important capability in the toolbox available to the AUV operator. In cases where it is appropriate, this can remove the need for the first survey pass, and gives the operator more flexibility in how to design the inspection mission. This paper highlights recent test results from industry-funded technology demonstration trials conducted along pipelines in the North Sea.

A major obstacle in the development of manned submersibles involves the removal of metabolically-produced carbon dioxide from the cabin environment, particularly during long-duration, cold water operations.  Traditional CO2 absorption methods utilized in underwater life support systems use alkali metal hydroxide chemical beds—mostly calcium hydroxide—which have been shown to have poor absorption efficiencies in cold environments.  Experimental evidence suggests that seawater, a readily accessible medium during submersible operations, could be a highly effective alternative scrubbing medium to remove metabolically-produced carbon dioxide.  Laboratory CO2 absorption trials are currently being conducted in a joint research effort between Duke University and the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, under sponsorship by the Office of Naval Research.  An overview of these absorption trials will be presented and the physical principles governing this absorption technique will be explained.   Alternative concept designs will be introduced and the suitability of these concepts for open and closed-circuit breathing systems will be discussed.

During the summer of 2011, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals was contracted by Saudi ARAMCO to conduct  an extensive surveys in the Red Sea where they wanted to conduct test drills for oil.  The survey was needed to complete a baseline assessment and to see if there were any critical habitat areas in or near the proposed well sights.
This presentation will cover the highlights and triumphs of a very ambitious expedition.
Some of the requirements for the tasking were an extremely tight work schedule, limited support facilities, accurate positioning for data collection and very specific data gathering.  Additionally, all of the work had to be conducted off of a 25’ Boston Whaler.
Due to these stringent requirements a VideoRay Pro4 ROV, KCF Technologies Smart Tether, LYYN Video Enhancement System and a  YSI  600XL Sonde Gauge were chosen to complete the survey.

Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) fill different niches within the underwater intervention task spectrum.  AUVs provide the capability for subsea inspection and survey on a variety of range scales and with multiple sensors, including sidescan and synthetic aperture sonar, sub-bottom profiling, multi-beam echosounding and still and video photography.  Small ROVs can provide inspection, repair and maintenance capabilities to assist the oil and gas industries in deep water environments.
Bluefin Robotics recently acquired the assets of Hawkes Remotes, Inc. (HRI), a spinoff from Hawkes Ocean Technologies (HOT) that develops advanced ROVs.  The HRI designs offer scalable, modular solutions including a thin, armored fiber-optic tether and on-board high-energy-density batteries that will reduce the total cost of ownership/operating costs while simultaneously outperforming existing ROV technology.  Bluefin will leverage their autonomy and subsea experience to add hybrid capabilities to the ROVs and offer them as an extension of their current product line to the oil and gas industry.  The presentation will show how the Bluefin/Hawkes capabilities in the AUV and ROV space provide complementary technologies that will enable a wide variety of underwater intervention tasks with a cost-effective footprint and low infrastructure support.

Since 2003, the Diver Certification Board of Canada (DCBC) has offered certification to commercial diving personnel who can demonstrate that they have sufficient training and experience to enable them to meet the competency requirements of the appropriate section of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Competency Standard for Diving Operations (CSA Standard Z275.4). The DCBC also accredits commercial diver training organizations which train to the competency levels of Z275.4.

For the past two years the DCBC has been working with schools, industry and other organisations to develop a certification scheme for ROV operating personnel.

The purpose of certifying the competence of ROV personnel (Pilot/Technicians and Supervisors) is to help ensure the safety of personnel, equipment, assets and the environment and includes the protection of divers who often work in the same underwater work site as a ROV.

In general the levels of certification and the competencies required to obtain certification are designed to meet the requirements of ROV Contractors and ROV end users.

HOW TO AID YOUR OPERATIONS IN REDUCING FAILURES

Richard Davidson and Eric Milne, The Subsea Company

The Surface or Subsea Data Logger is intended to give operators the ability to monitor key pressures and provide information in real-time.

The Subsea Company offers 2 types of Data Loggers:
1)	Surface Data Logger
2)	Subsea Data Logger

The Data Logger is specifically designed to capture pressure (P) vs. a set time (T) on a chart recorder or data-logger at high resolution. The test equipment is connected between a hydraulic supply and the equipment to be tested. While operating the equipment, pressure vs. time is recorded on a suitably scaled chart recorder or data-logger. The newly captured chart is compared against known good data. The performance curves are then interpreted to determine if the equipment is operating within an acceptable range. With the Data Logger information, one can determine if the equipment is operating as designed.

As for the Subsea Data Logger, equipment to record pressures and other data on the BOP Stack while subsea is independent of existing control pods and the data is accessible on the surface. The Subsea Data Logger units can be daisy-chained and placed on the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) and/or lower stack. The Data Logger's battery power source is good for long durations without a recharge. These batteries can be recharged subsea via ROV.  The data is multi-plexed onto a single mode fiber. The on board computer records data from up to 8 analog channels concurrently at a high data rate (up to 250,000 X 8 samples per second). ROV interface is provided for separate communications path to the unit.

Typical use for the Data Logger for Surface and/or Subsea:
o	Factory acceptance testing of RAM BOPs, annulars, connectors, valves, BOP stacks and trees
o	On-hire acceptance testing of production and offshore drilling rigs
o	Pre-deployment testing of trees and BOP stacks following repairs and maintenance
o	Before and after maintenance
o	To justify an extended maintenance period

Our proprietary Data Logger for Surface and/or Subsea will aid your operations in reducing failures. The Data Logger will also give the ability to be proactive with regards to possible government regulations.

This subject will address a recent accident that occured to a diver while performing an underwater welding operation.  The resulting investigation and root cause analysis lead to the identification of several unrealized conditions that aided in creating this "perfect storm."  These included such items as unaccounted power sources, unfamiliar with tools, unknown actual amperage from welder, and adjacent work groups.  The end result was a new, and more detailed JHA was created that addresses these hazards.  This JHA includes all of the best safet practices as laid out by the ADCI, but also takes it to the next level of pre-job set ups, and a firm commitment by AEP on how all U/W buring and welding work will conducted across the entire fleet.

Exploration and production activities for oil and gas are steadily increasing in subsea areas. Various methods exist to detect and localize subsea oil and gas emissions but there is still a lack of understanding the processes of subsea leakages, and technologies to detect and localize emissions from subsea installations at an early stage have to be improved. Detecting and localizing subsea oil and gas emissions means dealing with warm multiphase outflow consisting of oil phase, gas bubbles and dissolved gas (mainly Methane), formation water, mixing with cold seawater, and sometimes even the formation of additional solid gas hydrate phases. Recent field observations and hydrodynamic models of Methane-rich fluid transport at natural seeping sites indicate the distinct behavior of Methane-dominated fluids in seawater.
A successful leak detection strategy must focus on the different physicochemical fluid characteristics of Methane as a tracer for subsea oil and gas emissions in general. The feasibility of Hydrocarbon Sniffers for the detection, localization and subsequent validation of subsea oil and gas emissions has been proven in several ROV- and AUV-borne subsea flowline surveys from 2008 until today. Field experience and latest results will be presented for different environmental backgrounds, reaching from arctic areas to extreme shallow waters.

While it has been common industry practice to rely on hand written dive logs for divers and chamber runs for decompression, we have to rely completely on the integrity, quality, and capability of the human element to make detailed time and data entries without errors and while possibly being distracted by a great many things on deck.  Our company has been using electronic recorders and pressure sensors on chambers for years but now there exists a small device which we've been testing and have in practice for years which we issue to each diver and place in each of our chambers.  It records the time, depth, and temperature of the entire dive including the rates of ascent and descent.  They are a remarkable tool to counsel employees who violate descent and ascent rates or supervisors who allow surface intervals to go beyond the 5 minutes allowed between surfacing a diver and surface-decompression.

As a safety device, the recorders are completely indelible and the data is stored where it cannot be tampered with or changed.  They couple magnetically to upload data and there are no plugs or ports.  the only battery comes installed at the factory and they last approximately 10 years depending on usage.  These record chamber runs with precision and are completely intrinsic and sealed so there is no need to worry in an oxygen environment.  Testing is underway in our deep hyperbaric testing chamber to determine accuracy and integrity of its program and depth capability.

I hope to present this device and share the safe technology with all our members in January.

There is increasing pressure from government, industry and the public to protect the environment. Many underwater projects require the use of environmentally preferable, biodegradable products to bid for contracts. While initially more expensive, these fluids can save money and time when properly utilized. They can improve equipment performance, while protecting the user from costly fines and clean up in the event of a leak or spill.

Environmentally safe lubricants will be presented from a 'hands-on' perspective. The paper will review spills and response regulations. It will also cover major organizational and commercial initiatives that are the major driving forces behind their use.

The paper will explore the types of biodegradable products and how they interact with underwater equipment. Included will be their compatibility with hydraulics, pumps, sealing materials, hoses, and other important components. Water infiltration, high pressure, wide temperature range usage as well as ways to manage these challenges will also be discussed.

There will be a discussion of specific maintenance practices that are required to maintain long useful life of these fluids as well as long equipment life. This will include real world experience gained by several successful long term field demonstrations with commercial and military divers and ROVs. Data that will be used covers oil analysis, equipment inspections, operating conditions, and overall cost savings.

Fiber optic connectors deliver massive bandwidth in a minute footprint, and thus are becoming increasingly popular for ROV and manned submersibles for everything from vehicle control and HD cameras to tracking and fiber based sensors. However, there are numerous complex engineering considerations for such systems, given the rigorous demands of subsea applications. Thus, it's key to make informed decisions about how fiber optics should be integrated into a design from its inception to achieve the maximum advantage of the technology.

This report explores the theory of fiber optics, both operation and concepts of use, strategies for design, pros and cons, especially as they affect the trade-offs between single mode and multimode fiber for specific applications.
Further, it examines to the future of the technology and how it can shape the deep ocean industry, from low back reflectance connectors to bend-insensitive, high numerical aperture fiber options, which will allow even greater versatility and performance in robust connector shell designs.

Coring at flat even seafloor have been conducted. However, there are of slight difficulty for a conventional ROV to conduct at steep or irregular terrain seafloor because the ROV needs a function or mechanism to keep its attitude tenaciously being subjected to a reaction force.

One of advantageous ROVs for its operation is a flipper type crawler ROV which JAMSTEC has developed. Flipper type crawler system which can rotate a crawler itself provides not only an advantage mobility but also an high performance to hold on.

The authors conducted the running experiment of the flipper type crawler ROVs on sand, cobble, or rock reef seafloor. The authors also conducted an initial hard-rock coring experiment at steep and irregular terrain seafloor off Okinawa.
This paper presents the advantageous mobility of the flipper type crawler ROV which has been confirmed at sea trial and the possibility of hard-rock coring at steep or irregular terrain seafloor with it.

The world ocean remains the last unexplored space on earth. Underwater robots, when massively deployed, can bring huge benefit. Their use, however, is much more complicated than aerial or ground ones, due to communication problems. That is why enhancing intelligence of individual robots for increasing autonomy and reducing communications is the primary goal. In this paper we are offering a high-level distributed control technology that can dynamically integrate any underwater units into operable teams with a sort of global consciousness and pursuing global goals. It is based on universal knowledge processing and control modules easily installed in units and communicating with each other via any available channels. Ad hoc networks of these modules spatially, in parallel, interpret global mission descriptions in a special high-level Distributed Scenario Language (DSL) reflecting top semantics of what to be done in a distributed maritime space, while leaving system structuring and task-oriented C2 entirely to automatic language interpretation.  Extremely  short, created on the fly, DSL scenarios are injected into the robotic swarm from any unit, subsequently covering the whole system and setting the needed behavior, with communications between vehicles much shorter than with any other approaches (thus suitable for low speed channels). Implementation details of the technology will be revealed, and exemplary scenarios in DSL related to underwater environments, like collective distributed search of a large territory for specific objects or patrolling coastline will be shown. Cooperation with surface and aerial vehicles, also with higher-level manned systems within the same organizational model, are discussed too.

Offshore drilling has been in existence a little over 100 years. Drilling and production depths have accelerated greatly over the past several years and depths over 3000 meters (10,000 feet) are not uncommon.
This move into deeper and deeper waters has presented many technical and environmental challenges for ROVs and related equipment.
One of these challenges is that at the depths and significantly increased pressures that ROVs can see, the physical characteristics of hydraulic and dielectric fluids change. This paper explores the various factors that effect fluid characteristics including; pressure, temperature, viscosity, and type of fluid. It compares and contracts petroleum oils, environmentally safe oils and synthetics. It also includes a comparison of these fluids at atmospheric conditions to isolate any changes solely due to fluid type.

The presentation will focus on recent and anticipated trends for high pressure hydraulics in subsea applications, predominately in the oil production industry and how compact hydraulic intensifiers can be a cost effective and reliable solution.

Deeper Drilling-Higher Pressures.  Exploration in deeper water combined with higher safety margins are driving the need for higher hydraulic pressures.  We will review how some subsea procedures, such as seal testing, are requiring higher pressures, and how hydraulic intensifiers are responding to the need.

Reliability and Flexibility.  Being able to perform at depth and at a range of flows and pressures, is challenged when additional hydraulic fluids and process solutions are used.  Discussion will consider how recent design considerations with hydraulic intensifiers improve both reliability and flexibility.

Beyond ROV.  Some of the intervention applications that are served by ROVs, also need upgrading, such as BOP accumulator charging.  Discussion will cover how compact hydraulic intensifiers can be a cost effective solution.

There are a lot new ROVs have entered the market lately. The new trends are low logistics, highly maneuverable systems in addition rated up to 300m. The manufacturers always offer information about forward/backward/vertical/lateral speed of their ROV in ideal near surface conditions more rarely about thruster performance, but the real question of the operator is often about  the possibility of  survey the particular  bottom area in particular(preferably near maximum vehicle rating) depth in particular time under various but real sea conditions. Regardless of ROV mission type the operational challenges caused by the tether drag arise at 300m depths. One of the key features of observation ROVs is accessible bottom or structure survey area from fixed topside. The next is the ROV speed at underwater site which form the survey coverage rate.  Both are defined by ROV propulsion and tether management. This paper presents several models of observation class ROV based on analysis of specifications of commercially available ROV systems. We also discuss several environmental aspects of ROV deployment:  current profile, survey pattern. The tether computer model based on the numerical integration of equilibrium equation of the flexible nonstretchable line used to obtain the parameters of ROV motion according to selected typical ROV systems and environmental conditions. Survey speed and area quality indicators are estimated for several observation ROV models including those developed in the IMPT

In many applications, acoustic navigation systems (such as the commonly used USBL) cannot provide accurate positioning information. Because of multiple sound reflections, for instance, acoustic systems have poor performances in shallow water or highly cluttered areas, such as in a port environment, close to piers and various underwater structures. The users of large and very complex ROV's solve the above problem by outfitting their vehicles with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) and Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) that extend the use of their equipment much beyond the capabilities of acoustic systems. Unfortunately, though, this kind of equipment is not available to the users of small ROV, because of size, power demand and price reasons.

The ROV & Diver TRACKER  is a complete navigation system that includes a Fiber Optic Gyro (FOG), a DVL and multiple support sensor, suitable for installation into small and micro ROV's. This paper describes the system and the results obtained onboard a VideoRay micro ROV, where the TRACKER was integrated with both the vehicle and a BlueView SONAR.

Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) serve as the primary platform for a variety of operations in deep water.  ROVs must often be reconfigured with different tools or sensors to accomplish these missions.  However, integrating new sensors, equipment or tooling to a work-class ROV can be a difficult and time consuming experience.
The lack of standardization between different models of ROVs also makes preplanning the equipment integration difficult.  Taking the time to understand and address the basic considerations and the options available will help to prevent last minute emergencies.
This presentation will provide an overview of the primary concerns when integrating new equipment.  Considerations include the size and weight of the equipment, ROV-specific mechanical attachment points, hydraulic connections, and electrical power and communication requirements.

ABSTRACT:  Large, modularly constructed Li-Ion and Li-Polymer battery systems are now being constructed for manned under water vehicles.  A significant advantage of modular construction of large battery systems is the maintainability of the battery system and the economic edge gained by repairing a large battery system using a single, relatively inexpensive, replacement battery module.  Battery system modularity also provides an easy path to improved reliability and safety via redundancy.
	The presentation will describe the architecture of a 240 Volt, 58 KWh battery system constructed using 64 identical, autonomous battery modules that provide as much as 8X redundancy.  A list of continuously available normal and fault status for a module is described.  A consol display of this operational status for all 64 modules and of the overall system is provided.
	Both standard and state-of-the-art advances for operation, maintenance, and safety of the battery system will be described.  Significant among the state-of-the-art advances are:

1)  A fast, safe, & automatic, module balancing method for supporting module replacement that is typically 100X faster than conventional methods;
2)  Two means for determining module State Of Health;
3)  An innovative means for timely detection of internal shorts within any cell in the battery system; and
4)  Ability to extend battery life and improve safety by automatically adjusting the charge level of all the modules within the battery system.

	The presentation will also describe a means of packaging the 64 modules that allow for pressure equalization of the modules, for mounting the battery external to the manned compartment, and that subdivide the battery system into sections that can be jettisoned.

PRESENTATION BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  This presentation provides an overview of a modularly constructed 240 Volt 58 KWh Li-Polymer battery system for a manned deep submergence vehicle.  Architecture, operation, maintenance, and safety features of the battery system are provided.  An innovative method for rapid module replacement with immediate system availability is described.  Two new means for detection of battery module State Of Health is described and an automatic means for detection of cell internal shorts is described.  A means to extend battery life and safety using module charge control is described.  Packaging of the pressure equalized battery modules and battery system is described.

For 10 years, the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center’s international ROV competition program has challenged students to think creatively, work as part of a team, and apply technical skills in new and innovative ways.

However, in 2011 the Center took a new approach to encouraging students to develop 21st century workplace skills.  Instead of teams, MATE asked students to think of themselves as entrepreneurs and to form “companies” instead of “teams.”  We challenged them to develop an understanding of the breadth of business operations and to structure their company with the appropriate personnel – from CEOs to CFOs, Software Engineers to Marketing Directors,  Operations Managers to PR Specialists.  Not only were they expected to design, build, and perform, their “product,” they also had to sell it to their client – in this case, the MATE Center and the industry professionals who volunteer as competition judges.

The response was positive – and powerful!  Students and mentors took the challenge very seriously.  They came up with creative names for their companies and, in some cases, developed a company logo.  They identified the positions necessary for a business to run successfully and assigned students to those roles.  They created business cards and marketing materials that described their company and product line.  (One company developed an “app” that is available for download on the iTunes store.)  They wore suits and ties during their engineering presentations.  They gave cost and delivery estimates for their product and, if they had competed before, their record of past performance.

Based on this success, the MATE competition will continue its entrepreneurial approach and add to it in 2012.  For example, in order to reach out to and further engage students with an interest in technology but an aptitude in the arts, MATE will ask companies to develop PR “kits” and put them into practice by targeting their local media.

The concept of ROV subsea inertial navigation and ROV mounted Multibeam has been around for a number of years. In a recent offshore project the two systems were tightly integrated so the inertial system provided Heading, pitch, roll and position directly to the Multibeam. The paper discusses the integration processes – good parts and bad. In the results errors in the system are shown and how they were resolved. Also demonstrates the 2 way LBL and inertial for ROV navigation. The paper gives real project result from the Gulf of Mexico with some spectacular images.

The mission of Rozalia Project for a Clean Ocean is to find and remove marine debris from our oceans, bays and rivers. Marine debris takes many forms, and occurs in all marine environments, presenting myriad challenges in removing it from the water. Rachael Miller of Rozalia Project uses a VideoRay with BlueView sonar, Lyyn image enhancement, and Smart Tether positioning system along with the Tritech Starfish side scan sonar, to scour the bottom of a variety of venues looking for and retrieving marine debris - from small pieces of plastic to large masses of derelict fishing gear - and everything in-between. This presentation will show specific examples of how the equipment is integrated and used in concert to locate and recover a variety of objects of differing size and material, and how different benthic environments and conditions affect mission planning and execution. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of lessons learned and the strategies Rachael used to handle specific challenges related to debris search and recovery.

The use of VideoRays in the Offshore Oil & Gas Industry is growing rapidly, as recent results of inspections of facilities and vessels around the world show that this is compelling technology. Inspections can often be done more rapidly, efficiently, safely, and at lower cost than other traditional methods. In many cases there are critical areas and mechanisms that cannot be inspected safely by ANY other method. The extreme portability, small size, low power consumption of modern micro ROVs combined with their depth, current handling, and tether pulling capabilities combine to provide completely new tactics, techniques, and procedures.

This presentation covers case studies where Van Meter Consulting has used Micro ROVs to support offshore oil and gas projects. From Russia's Siberian LNG, to an FPSO in the South China Sea, to the Gulf of Mexico, photos and video clips will demonstrate how this maturing technology is being used in the offshore environment. Van Meter will explain how he won the jobs, planned for the mission, adjusted and compensated when things were not working, and successfully completed the mission each time.

Robotics plays an increasing role in STEM education.   It provides for a systems level curricula which encompasses and integrates many disciplines:  mathematics, mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, and domain specific problem solving.     Adding the aspect of underwater exploration to the story makes the use of robotics even more compelling as a driver of improvements to STEM education.  The unique scientific component of underwater exploration allows for the combination of non-engineering scientific elements such biology, geology, oceanography and even archeology.
The commercial micro ROV provides benefits as an educational tool.   The primary benefits being ease of use and logistics, relative low cost, multiplicity of roles, and system completeness.   The microROV also enables a continuum of development which synchronizes well with other popular STEM efforts.
This talk will discuss some of the ways in which VideoRay fosters undersea robotics in educational roles.   The applicability to students in various stages of development from k-12 to post-graduate will be discussed.   Suggestions on ways other commercial organizations can more proactively support improvements to STEM education will be covered.

Our agency was contacted by the Holmes County Sheriff’s Office after all other efforts failed to locate the remains of a cave diver who reportedly failed to return to the surface after a deep cave penetration dive into Vortex Springs.
   Before we left to assist with our Pro 4 ROV we were told that the missing diver was believed to be deep in the cave (approx 1,400 feet), in an area where the diameter of the tube where the diver was thought to be was equal to the size of the diver. Before our arrival experienced cave divers had searched the inside of the cave, and penetrated approx 1,200 feet into the cave. It was hoped that the ROV could reach an additional 200 feet, which was the limit of the mapped system. This area of the cave was not much larger that the ROV itself, and the ROV, or any diver reaching this point would not be able to turn around to exit the cave.
   Unfortunately we were not able to locate the lost diver, but this presentation will review the challenges we encountered using an ROV in these most difficult circumstances, in a rarely attempted type of search and recovery mission. I will also talk about the equipment used during this attempted recovery, the support supplied by Video Ray, and the lessons learned during the mission.

In order to quantify the effect of biofouling on ship performance, an accurate measure must be made of the fouling on the ship. This biofouling is very dependent on timing and ship service. Inspections must be carried out immediately after a ship’s return, and before a deployment. Not only are multiple, repeatable points to be inspected on the ship, but the ability must exist to do so anywhere in the world and on short notice. Both divers and ROVs were utilized to accomplish this mission.
By utilizing both divers and ROVs, NSWC Carderock Division has been able to provide a consistent, high-quality survey of Navy ship hulls to meet the goals of the experiment. The lessons learned from over 60 hull inspections in two years will be shared. These include comments on rapid response, ship tagouts, ruggedization for air shipment of systems, and a novel CONOP for small-footprint operation on a pier. Divers and ROVs need not be competitors. By playing to the strengths of both, a much better product can be produced, and vital data can be gathered that would otherwise be missed.

The low-logistics associated with microROVs make it an ideal platform for rapid deployment. With microROVs, first respondents are able to rapidly mobilize to an area, run a survey and interact with the subsea environment if required. The time it takes to run a search and the confidence to report that the area has been cleared is often time-crucial for the success of the mission. Recent advances in technology have seen the introduction of software solutions to automate and simplify the piloting of the ROV by analyzing data gathered from navigation and sonar sensors.  Over the last few years technology developments have reduced the size of these sensors and it is now possible to introduce some of the technologies in use with observation-class and work-class ROVs. This talk explores a solution that integrates a phased array Doppler Velocity Log with a microROV and enables a true survey capability that, to date, would normally only be found with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. The Survey-Control software simplifies the piloting of ROVs, improves the situational awareness of the operator and increases the pace of operations.  With this tool, first respondents will be able to fly the ROV with significantly less training and guide the ROV precisely around the environment.

Remotely operated vehicles have become a commonplace undersea tool.  However there are still people pushing the boundaries of technological development and finding new ways to repurpose current technology to new tasks.
The micro-ROV lends itself to non-traditional use more so than its bigger brethren.  The lower cost, lower complexity, and ease of transportation and operational insertion promote novel uses and experimentation.  The micro-ROV also packs many capabilities into a systems package: imaging and navigation sensors, propulsion, illumination, pressure vessel, power, communications, etc.
This talk will discuss some examples of such non-traditional uses by VideoRay customers and ways in which manufactures can foster and leverage this type of end-user application.

Originally presented at the Transportation Research Board in January 2011.  This paper discusses systems and techniques that have been utilized to restore the structural integrity and protect concrete, steel, and woodpiles for more than 35 years. Many bridges in active use today are well beyond their intended designed life.  Since it would be much too costly and time consuming to replace these bridges with new bridges, proven repair and rehabilitation systems are critical to the life and safety of these structures. This paper will discuss the use of the FX-70 Inert Corrosion Free fiberglass jacket system that utilizes FX-70-6 Hydro-Ester Multipurpose Marine Epoxy and FX-225 Underwater Mortar specifically designed for bridge pile restoration.

Metal parts hate water, especially salt water. Add the effects of depth pressure and the rough operating conditions often experienced in the field and the marine parts designer faces unique and difficult challenges.  Frequently plastic is the answer.  Advances in plastic materials and manufacturing processes make that increasingly the case.  Plastic neither rusts nor corrodes, can be as tough as metal, is lightweight, has no magnetic signature, and can be formed into a wide variety of shapes.  Plastic parts can be designed to withstand extreme depth pressures, to minimize or eliminate leak paths, not to outgas, and for specific underwater signal reflection, transmission, or attenuation characteristics.  Plastic can be used to encapsulate delicate electronics, GPS modules, antennae, and power connectors.  This presentation provides an overview of the present state of the art in plastics materials and manufacturing processes for undersea applications and highlights particularly difficult missions where plastic parts have been critical to success.  Highlighted missions include:
•	AUVs discovering Air France 447 wreckage 2 ½ miles down in the Atlantic
•	Combat divers mapping a harbor minefield
•	Navy SEALS conducting  underwater special ops
•	In-situ instruments monitoring ocean conditions for weather forecasting and climate modeling
•	ROVs  working on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico

For over thirty years, Polymer Corporation has been a leading producer of high-performance plastic parts and assemblies for undersea use.

Subsea power has long been identified as a challenging component of designing and operating underwater equipment. There is a continuous demand for reliable energy sources that allows equipment to run for longer, operate at deeper depths, and offer enhanced performance.
This presentation will outline the challenges of subsea power and describe the benefits of modular pressure-tolerant batteries. It will also highlight how this type of battery can effectively be used to supply power for a multitude of subsea applications such as AUVs, ROVs, benthic instrumentation and actuation of subsea equipment.
The talk will describe the characteristics of the underlying technology, the design methodology and historical development and the characteristics of pressure-tolerant batteries ranging from small replaceable units (1.5kWh / 30V) to larger units (29.6kWh /  240V). Field data of the battery performance in AUVs and possibly other platforms will also be presented.
Additionally, a new method of achieving safer performance of lithium-based battery packs will be presented. The method essentially prevents the propagation of fire among cells within a pack effectively yielding a safer energy supply. Recent research was conducted that included testing of fundamentally safer cells that shut down following an unsafe event. Results from this research will be shared.

Abstract for UI-2012

RHOV PERSONNEL SPHERE UPDATE - THE END IS IN SIGHT

Southwest Research Institute® (SwRI®) is under contract to WHOI to design, fabricate and test the titanium personnel sphere that will be installed in the upgraded ALVIN submersible. SwRI is nearing completion of the fabrication and testing phases for the new personnel sphere. The personnel sphere will be tested in the Annapolis Test Chambers for a 6500 MSW maximum operating depth. The fabrication and testing had been expected to be completed but the decision to have the personnel sphere dual certified by both ABS and NAVSEA has resulted in schedule delays. All major weldments and the final machining of all components have been completed without experiencing any appreciable distortion or change in out-of-sphericity. Component assembly and structural validation tests are in progress. Stud welding procedures for the viewport windows and the hatch have been developed and are being employed.  A strain gauge location plan is being developed based upon an as-built dimensional FEA model and analysis. A comprehensive hydrostatic test procedure is being developed and going through the dual approval process leading up to the hydro test in the Spring of 2012.  SwRI will deliver the sphere and documentation to WHOI after the hydro test to complete our contract. The status and activities since last year and activities to complete the personnel sphere in 2012 will be discussed

The last five years has seen the advent of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) automation solutions. The challenges posed by a rapidly expanding ROV pilot workforce, dynamic working environments and increasing demands on quality and performance have been the main drivers for this technology. A good example of its application is the 2008 Doc Ricketts vehicle. This was a Workclass ROV (WROV) equipped with the basic autonomy building blocks to enable station keeping, waypoint following and object tracking. The Doc Ricketts WROV is still in active service with MBARI. This basic capability paved the way for commercial applications and now station keeping is a standard option. More recently, Jan De Nul Fall Pipe ROV is an example that uses COTS sophisticated cruise and mission planning modules. This world's first enables precise positioning of the ROV over a pipeline as it swings from side to side and places rocks over the product. Available capabilities today include real-time monitoring and control of multiple ROVs relative to chart data, mid-water DP using INS and tracking sonar, pre-lay survey flight modes and hands-off touchdown monitoring using sonar. The combination of data from optical cameras with 3D sonar imaging will further enhance the mapping of the subsea environment to facilitate various activities such as mission planning and training.

The purpose of this talk is to provide an insight into this technology and a glimpse of what to expect in the immediate future.

ROV deployed cutting tools are an important part of the subsea toolbox, and are essential equipment for the installation  and decommissioning of subsea tiebacks and other subsea installations.
An overview of the available technologies will be discussed, with particular focus given to the correct selection of the tool to suit the application.  Guidance will be given regarding the safe deployment, use, retrieval and storage of subsea cutting tools, with particular focus on those deployed by ROV to deep water.
Improvements in the strength of wire rope technology and the increasing use of aramid based soft lines pose particular challenges to current cutting technology.  This will be discussed along with improvements that can be made to ensure modern cutting tools are capable of producing the cutting forces required whilst still maintaining a low enough weight and size for ROV deployment.

Trends in underwater salvage and excavation markets indicate improved access
to remote areas and complex dredging methods are more available to subsea
operators than previously.

Deepwater and ultra-deepwater decommissioning and salvage efforts have
forged alternatives to standard vertical access and mass excavation
techniques. For structural removal, horizontal penetration is possible
beyond normal vertical dredge pumping. Hydraulically driven dredge pumps
placed on the sea bed and connected with long-length hydraulic hoses deliver
power from host vessels on the surface.

Advanced imaging equipment can penetrate fixed structures in zero visibility
conditions. This allows more precise ROV manipulation of excavation tooling.
Combined with real-time ROV positioning, these imaging tools enable the ROV
to navigate with"acoustic" cameras.

Modern subsea field developments have tighter templates with more densely
located subsea assets. When excavating these templates, horizontal
transportation of the spoils prevents other asset areas from potential
burial.

Drill cuttings often deposit around wellheads during drilling operations.
ROVs equipped with dredging hardware can disperse the drill cuttings to
desirable areas in the adjacent vicinity, keeping wellheads clear and even
with the natural sea bottom.

In response to the complexity of the missions they are asked to perform, ROVs continue to become more powerful and complicated in design.  When a component fails, repair tasks can take multiple hours and have a significant economic impact on ROV operators and their customers.  In all instances of major ROV subsystem repairs, the component that needs to be replaced or repaired is located in the second or third tier of the design; gaining access to and repairing the failed component can require multiple hours of work.  For example, a HPU replacement on a conventional ROV can typically take 8 hours.  With an average pipelay vessel day rate of $180,000, the vessel downtime cost of such a task can easily mount to $60,000 or more.

An assessment of this issue showed that it was not feasible to achieve step-change improvements in repair tasks without revisiting the overall system design philosophy and placing a significant focus on the primary challenges of time to repair and ability to perform the repair correctly the first time.  As a result, Schilling Robotics has invested in developing ROV technology that can be repaired within 60 minutes, providing a significant increase in ROV system uptime and customer profitability.

This presentation will review features important in reducing downtime including: modular subsystem design, component accessibility, ease of replacement, and removal of the potential for installation errors during the maintenance process.  Major ROV subsystem examples will be discussed, including the HPU, the electrical power distribution system, and the tether/umbilical terminations.

Florida State University Panama City (FSUPC) completed an evaluation study in 2010 that examined the techniques and tools available for the execution of the search and inspection activities that public safety divers are routinely called upon to perform.  The test teams were drawn from major ports across the country and were selected for their experience and skill in conducting port security operations as well as routine public safety dive functions.  The teams included Seattle Police Department Harbor Patrol, NYPD Scuba Team, Jacksonville Sheriff Office Dive Team, and the FBI’s USERT team out of Los Angeles. A team from FSUPC’s Underwater Crime Scene Investigation was utilized to augment the dataset.  The findings indicated that traditional and technology-augmented search techniques were all very successful methods, particularly in the specific contexts for which they were developed.  However, broader implications to ROV training and use were suggested by the results.  While these observations were beyond the scope of the study, they provide valuable insights that are shared in this paper.

Remotely Operated Vehicles were used during two trips to the Tsunami damaged areas in the Iwate Prefecture of Japan. In April 2011 four ROV’s were used to inspect infrastructure and to assist with victim search and recovery.  The ROV’s successfully allowed a fishing port to be reopened and were used to search for victims in debris to dangerous for manual search with divers. During this trip a SeaBotix SARbot, a SeaBotix LBV-300-5, a SeaMor ROV and an AC-ROV were used. A second trip in October 2011 saw a return to the city of Minamisanriku Cho. The city had requested an expanded search for debris in the ports and open areas of the bay where fishing nets were to be redeployed. Based on lessons learned in April a SeaBotix SARbot was chosen.  This paper will present data and lessons learned from the two trips.

The Great Lakes Naval Memorial and Museum (GLNMM) has developed a program that utilizes ROV kits and a professional build ROV to promote STEM based education for all ages. These programs utilize underwater technology to provide educational activities that promote a greater understanding of the underwater environment through direct interaction. The technology used in these programs are small underwater robots referred to as remotely operated vehicles or ROVs. These ROVs can be created, designed and build by students or other program participants such as teachers. GLNMM has created a traveling educational outreach program that includes classes of different lengths and levels for people of all ages and backgrounds. These classes can be offered at locations throughout the region and include two separate experiences. The first experience is creating and building a ROV that the participants can use to explore the underwater environment. The second part is the opportunity to drive a professionally build ROV to explore underwater to depths of several hundred feet. Most dives are in only in depths of fifty feet or less. This technology allows the participants an experience similar to being a SCUBA diver.

In this talk we present a comprehensive survey procedure developed in-house and deployed on a recent survey mission in Mount Hope Bay to locate two ship wreckages using an Iver2. The vehicles were equipped with a Klein Side Scan Sonar, an Imagenex Delta-T multi-beam sensor and a Sontec Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) sensor. We present details on the in water compass calibration procedure that was developed using an Extended Kalman Filtering approach.   In addition, details on mission specification, localization including slant range correction and logging of multi-beam and side-scan sonar data are also presented. The multi-beam and side-scan data are prost-processed for automatic as well as manual artifact identification. Some sample results are also presented. We envision this comprehensive approach to be adopted for  multiple applications such as SLAM, hydrographic survey and underwater inspection missions.

This paper discusses some of the unique benefits of the use of real-time 3D imaging sonar technology as a multi-discipline sensor. This technology can provide exceptional data in real-time monitoring applications as well as mapping and survey applications, saving considerable money in complex and time sensitive operations. With the benefit of fully geo-referenced 3D data sets for every ping, the use of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) is possible, allowing a fully immersive "augmented reality" environment for operators, engineers and clients all in real-time. In addition to the real-time monitoring benefits, 3D imaging sonar provides huge data redundancy which is available for in-line processing algorithms to improve accuracy, provide automatic noise and clutter removal, and produce incredible image detail over what could be normally achieved by current 2D and multibeam sonar technology.

The SENSE IT project provides high school students the opportunity to build, calibrate and test a set of sensors and circuits, to measure a variety of physical quantities. To build and understand their sensors, student use a wide range of core knowledge of mathematics and physical science, as well as learning practical technology skills such as soldering and debugging circuits. Then students interface their sensors with computers, write programs to gather raw signals from the sensors, implement calibration curves, and perform data manipulation and data logging. Students then program their own communications protocols for wireless data transmission and connect their computerized sensor stations together to form a distributed wireless sensor network.

SENSE IT promotes student awareness of the interdisciplinary nature of modern engineering and the interdependence of diverse areas of science and math. The theme of environmental stewardship and sensor systems provides: 1) a motivating and meaningful scenario for learning a wide range of core math, science and technology topics, 2) an engaging link between biological, physical and social sciences and 3) a cutting-edge example of science and engineering research, delivered directly into the classroom in a particular area of growing importance and workforce need.

In an effort to provide realistic educational experiences for students, the MATE Center works closely with marine industry professionals to develop ROV competition mission tasks that model real world scenarios.  The goal of the MATE Center missions is to present challenges students might experience in the field and familiarize them with another aspect of the underwater industry.

The 2012 mission theme deals with 20th century shipwrecks and their potential environmental threats.    Working with the Professional Marine Explorers Society, the MATE Center is developing tasks that include surveying the wreck and removing fuel from a corroding tank.  Replicating this complex problem involves creating mission props that are designed with inexpensive hardware store technology, allowing teams around the world to copy MATE Center designs.  Underwater missions also take place in a pool environment, with clear, warm water, generally less than 6 meters deep.  Working within these limitations, the MATE Center mission tasks model real world events that students might experience in the underwater industry.

The MATE Center provides an outlet for students of all ages to build and test Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). MATE Center goes through great lengths to plan and simulate ‘real-world’ problems as the basis for their competitions. From submarine search and rescue operations to underwater sea mount exploration and, more recently, oil spill containment, the competitions attempt to simulate reality.

Georgia Tech Savannah Robotics’ ROV Beta Mk II is a direct product of the MATE competition. This vehicle was featured in a summer research trip to the Louisiana Gulf Coast to search for remnants of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The same system originally developed for competition collected water samples for oil content analysis at the Gulf Coast site.

This year, Beta Mk II is slated to survey recently unearthed Revolutionary War shipwrecks off the coast of Yorktown, VA. For 2012, the MATE ROV Competition again aligns with the real world research plan for the vehicle. This talk will outline the competition influences on design, the differences in real world performance vs. competition, and the future work inspired by the competition.

Multibeam imaging sonars have been available since the early nineties and have served well as a tool to improve situational awareness. Operators can observe targets at distances of tens to hundreds of yards and use the information to navigate underwater vehicles and monitor important subsea regions. The original systems were significant in size and weight and required large electronic pods to beam form and process the raw data. But today’s multibeam imaging sonars are of a size suitable for microROV operation, so much so that they have become a common payload option for many operators. In tandem software solutions enabling close control of unmanned systems using through-the-sensor servoing techniques have evolved to a level of maturity suitable for commercial exploitation. The bringing together of this technology with the microROV will enable a new level of user control to the operational users. A common task such as flying to a target can be a difficult undertaking when faced with currents and tether effects, when time is at a premium this can be frustrating and negatively impact the overall mission needs. This proposed technology enables the microROV to keep station relative to an object or structure identified in the sonar data. The ROV can then maneuver relative to this object and the pilot need only provide simple point-and-click commands on the sonar screen. This talk will illustrate some early results on early prototype work.

Traditionally, naval architecture has been more craft than science. Determining what is ‘right’ in a particular situation in the absence of definitive supporting analysis encompasses the art of naval architecture to this day.  With the advent of computers, naval architects began to move their work from ‘the drawing board’ into the computer and its display.  This presentation describes the evolution of computer-based naval architecture tools from the early stages circa 1980 through the present, from the point of view of a team that pioneered tools which gained a diverse user community over that time frame.  This team’s story reflects progress and successes as well as continuing opportunities for advancement. Technical domains such as hull form design, hydrostatics and stability, structures, and weights and moments will be included, with applications to underwater vehicles discussed.  Technology developments related to software architecture and development processes will be highlighted, as well as a view toward future opportunities to further integrate and extend the scope of marine vehicle design tools.

The capabilities of the Triton XLX Heavy Work Class ROV have been well proven since introduction to the Offshore Industry five years ago.  Reliability, adaptability, load carrying capacity and volume for equipment and tool deployment, are the solid foundations on which the system is based.  Coupled with a state of the art control system, the ROV has become a formidable tool in the contractor's armoury, with over 70 systems built.
New developments in equipment and control such as HD cameras, LED lighting and DVL auto-position have been gradually introduced to meet the ever increasing demands of operators.  The innovative PSS Type 4 and Type 5 TMS have further enhanced the ROV system, providing large tether storage capacity in compact lightweight units.
Building on this success, the new Generation 2 vehicles now offer increasing operator control throughout the water column, with the ROVDP multi-sensor control system which includes full capability for auto waypoint control, remote mission navigation and auto pipe and cable following functions.  Additionally increased vehicle on board power, with true 200 shaft hp systems, that feature enhanced tooling hydraulic capacity, with full flow proportional take offs, add to the vehicle capabilities.  4160V power systems allow optimisation of umbilical to 4000m water depths.  These ROVs are complemented by a wide range of stainless steel TMS and garage options, from small systems carrying 450m of tether, up to the most recent Type 6 TMS development that gives large excursions up to 1500m.
The these innovative features and the benefits to the operator that they bring, are presented.

While underwater operations provide a host of significant anxieties, when a sheet of ice is added to the picture the pressure increases similar to a diver descending down the water column.  Past practice - putting human life in jeopardy by traversing unsafe ice conditions or by placing divers into a confined space is no longer advisable.  Micro-ROV technology allows first responders to locate, inspect, and retrieve rapidly, efficiently, safely, and cost-effectively.  The requirement of cutting large holes for under ice diving creates future public hazards until solid freeze up occurs.   The extremely small hole required of the Micro-ROV minimizes vulnerability and can easily be made safe upon completion of the task.
The Micro-ROV is easily deployed, with minimal risk, into a potential human trap eliminating travel to the unknown.  The Micro-ROV can without difficulty, assess hazards, survey the scene, locate and identify targets, recover evidence and provide a safe lane of travel for a diver.  It doesn’t matter if it is an object that has fallen through or a survey that needs to be done; the employment of Micro-ROV under ice operation is a safe first alternative.
This presentation will show the experiences of several small ROV projects successfully employed in under-ice operations, along with lessons learned from the agencies involved.  Projects include locating vehicles fallen through the ice, drowning victims and ice rescue training.

Waterjet technology has been developed for application in deepwater (3,000m+) environments. It offers several important advantages over existing technologies and presents new opportunities for continued refinement of subsea maintenance, repair, salvage, and emergency response techniques.

Advances in waterjet intensifier pump technology allow it to be applied subsea as a cutting tool in emergency response situations, or simply as an ultra-high pressure stream of water for coating or marine growth removal in applications such as isolation of welds for inspection. It may also be used as a tool to provide turbulence in a stream of methanol for tasks such as hydrate remediation and is effective at cutting steel up to 250 mm thick. The tool in a waterjet system cannot bind in the cut to jeopardize asset integrity, and it eliminates the hazard of igniting trapped pockets of gas during cutting.

Waterjet technology has been extended into the deepwater subsea space during the past year. Inclusion of an intensifier style subsea waterjet system in the collection of emergency response assets will give another option for cutting, salvage, and conduct of rapid de-mobilization operations.
