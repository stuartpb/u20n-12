This presentation will cover new technologies available to divers in commercial, military or scientific roles that will provide them with more capabilities, and a safer work environment.

Off the shelf technology now exists to give divers the ability to see and work in zero visibility, detect and track buried objects, accurately navigate over large distances, inspect structures, as well as gather accurate bathymetric / hydrographic data.

This presentation will present an overview of these new technologies and provide examples of how they can be used by different types of divers to offer new services, as well as make existing jobs safer and more efficient.

This Presentation will deal with the following examples:

Commercial Diving;
Buried pipe and cable tracking, Structural inspections, searches

Military Diving
MCM operations, Rapid beach profiling, covert operations, SAR operations

Scientific diving
Archaeological mapping, bathymetry

Law Enforcement
SAR operations, Crime scene investigations

    abstract=[[
During the summer of 2011, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals was contracted by Saudi ARAMCO to conduct  an extensive surveys in the Red Sea where they wanted to conduct test drills for oil.  The survey was needed to complete a baseline assessment and to see if there were any critical habitat areas in or near the proposed well sights.

This presentation will cover the highlights and triumphs of a very ambitious expedition.

Some of the requirements for the tasking were an extremely tight work schedule, limited support facilities, accurate positioning for data collection and very specific data gathering.  Additionally, all of the work had to be conducted off of a 25’ Boston Whaler.

Due to these stringent requirements a VideoRay Pro4 ROV, KCF Technologies Smart Tether, LYYN Video Enhancement System and a  YSI  600XL Sonde Gauge were chosen to complete the survey.

    abstract=[[
Robotics plays an increasing role in STEM education. It provides for a systems level curricula which encompasses and integrates many disciplines: mathematics, mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, and domain specific problem solving. Adding the aspect of underwater exploration to the story makes the use of robotics even more compelling as a driver of improvements to STEM education.  The unique scientific component of underwater exploration allows for the combination of non-engineering scientific elements such biology, geology, oceanography and even archeology.
The commercial micro ROV provides benefits as an educational tool. The primary benefits being ease of use and logistics, relative low cost, multiplicity of roles, and system completeness.   The microROV also enables a continuum of development which synchronizes well with other popular STEM efforts.
This talk will discuss some of the ways in which VideoRay fosters undersea robotics in educational roles. The applicability to students in various stages of development from k-12 to post-graduate will be discussed. Suggestions on ways other commercial organizations can more proactively support improvements to STEM education will be covered.

American Electric Power, a Sustaining Member of ADCI, continues to conduct training of its employees in the rules and regulations of commercial diving via OSHA, US Coast Guard and the ADCI Consensus Standards.  Training programs are conducted each year at selected AEP facilities for new students and re-qualifying Diving Contacts.  Criteria for becoming a Diving Contact at AEP is delineated in their program and requires each person to be nominated by management, complete the program and a written examination.  They serve in the program for a period of three years and must re-qualify by attending refresher training.  An AEP Diving Contact works directly with diving contractors at any AEP facility.  They are familiar with all diving regulations and the Consensus Standards, including Rev. 6, and can work the diving tables for repetitive dives, surface decompression on air or oxygen for example. Since they understand parts of our industry; they really make it easier for a diving contractor to communicate with them.  Dave Scarberry has been their Diving Coordinator and the originator of their program since inception and is responsible for its development and administration.  Will Hux is the instructor from MESCO/ Stroud Diving & Hydrography and wrote the training curriculum for the classroom portion of the training.  They make a strong team in presenting a safety program of which is an industry first.

Jesuit High School successfully completed missions designed by the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center to cap a flowing oil well and assess environmental damage, simulating the challenges that BP encountered in the gulf oil spill.  The MATE Center holds an annual ROV competition and hosts high school, college, and university teams from around the world.  The 2011 competition was held at the NASA Neutral Buoyancy Lab in Houston, Texas, adding the challenge of withstanding a depth of 40 feet.  The Jesuit High School Robotics Team, with a budget of $15,000 and a schedule of 20 workdays, manufactured the winning ROV with modular accessories specifically designed for each task, Ethernet communications, and a vectored control system.  This presentation will provide an overview of the ROV, including the design process, control system, accessories, and potential full scale applications.

Case studies will include but not be limited to an impact-damaged well head, a deepwater pipeline damaged by anchor impacts, and heavily corroded mooring components.

    abstract=[[
For 10 years, the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center’s international ROV competition program has challenged students to think creatively, work as part of a team, and apply technical skills in new and innovative ways.

However, in 2011 the Center took a new approach to encouraging students to develop 21st century workplace skills.  Instead of teams, MATE asked students to think of themselves as entrepreneurs and to form “companies” instead of “teams.”  We challenged them to develop an understanding of the breadth of business operations and to structure their company with the appropriate personnel – from CEOs to CFOs, Software Engineers to Marketing Directors,  Operations Managers to PR Specialists.  Not only were they expected to design, build, and perform, their “product,” they also had to sell it to their client – in this case, the MATE Center and the industry professionals who volunteer as competition judges.

The response was positive – and powerful!  Students and mentors took the challenge very seriously.  They came up with creative names for their companies and, in some cases, developed a company logo.  They identified the positions necessary for a business to run successfully and assigned students to those roles.  They created business cards and marketing materials that described their company and product line.  (One company developed an “app” that is available for download on the iTunes store.)  They wore suits and ties during their engineering presentations.  They gave cost and delivery estimates for their product and, if they had competed before, their record of past performance.

Based on this success, the MATE competition will continue its entrepreneurial approach and add to it in 2012.  For example, in order to reach out to and further engage students with an interest in technology but an aptitude in the arts, MATE will ask companies to develop PR “kits” and put them into practice by targeting their local media.
