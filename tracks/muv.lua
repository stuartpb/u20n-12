This presentation will be divided in two parts.  The first part will be a brief history of the use of semi-submersible vessels for drug trafficking, beginning with the 2006 seizure of the first confirmed semi-submersible and concluding with the seizures of two fully submersible vessels in 2010.  I will provide technical specifications of those seized as well as the drug trafficking organization requirements for a submersible to be a viable method of delivery.

The second part of the presentation will be the implications of the suspected use of submersibles by drug traffickers for the submersible community.  This will include the perception of submersibles by the law enforcement community, the potential of misidentification of a legally operated submersible as a threat, and the necessity of standard operating procedures by legitimate submersible operators to help avoid this misidentification.

I will use examples of both submersible and surface vessel operations, as well as other examples from various transportation sectors.  These examples will clarify how other industries help to separate legitimate from illegitimate operators to ensure both their economic and physical survival.

Abstract for UI-2012

RHOV PERSONNEL SPHERE UPDATE - THE END IS IN SIGHT

Southwest Research Institute® (SwRI®) is under contract to WHOI to design, fabricate and test the titanium personnel sphere that will be installed in the upgraded ALVIN submersible. SwRI is nearing completion of the fabrication and testing phases for the new personnel sphere. The personnel sphere will be tested in the Annapolis Test Chambers for a 6500 MSW maximum operating depth. The fabrication and testing had been expected to be completed but the decision to have the personnel sphere dual certified by both ABS and NAVSEA has resulted in schedule delays. All major weldments and the final machining of all components have been completed without experiencing any appreciable distortion or change in out-of-sphericity. Component assembly and structural validation tests are in progress. Stud welding procedures for the viewport windows and the hatch have been developed and are being employed.  A strain gauge location plan is being developed based upon an as-built dimensional FEA model and analysis. A comprehensive hydrostatic test procedure is being developed and going through the dual approval process leading up to the hydro test in the Spring of 2012.  SwRI will deliver the sphere and documentation to WHOI after the hydro test to complete our contract. The status and activities since last year and activities to complete the personnel sphere in 2012 will be discussed

Since 1986 MSUBS has been producing small, diesel-electric submersibles; coupled with recent rapid prototypng projects, in concert with Submergence Group, that produced manned and unmanned vehicles ranging from 10-65 tons, MSUBS and Submergence Group have embarked on a project to produce the world's first privately owned and operated ocean-going diesel-electric submarine for research purposes.  The submarine, as yet unnammed, will be approximately 30 meters in length with a beam of nearly 4 meters and be capable of diving to 300msw and trasitting vast ocean distances while snorkelling.  The presentation will provide an overview of the submarine design and production plans.

This presentation will trace the development and use of two manned submersibles on budgets that are a fraction of other vehicles with similar capabilities.  The first one of these was began in 1989 and named C-BUG (Controlled by Buoyancy Underwater Glider). It was one of the first winged subs ever made and enjoyed a successful career spanning over 550 dives in three countries. The next vehicle was named Idabel, and despite an initial budget of under 100k it has made over 900 dives to depths of up to half a mile.   In addition to keeping manufacturing costs low, operating costs have been kept low as well by a location choice that offers immediate access to deep water without the need for a support craft of any sort. A third aspect to the low operating costs has been the engineering of Idabel for minimum displacement. This craft carries two passengers and a pilot and weighs in at just over 9,000 pounds, making it not only less expensive to build and operate, but giving it a distinct advantage for photography. This formula has resulted in dive rates that start at just $400 per person for a 1000 foot dive, and a day rate of $2,000 for up to 6 hour-long dives.

Since OceanGate acquired the Antipodes manned submersible (former PC-1501) two years ago, we have been deploying her on different missions in support of ocean exploration, marine research, filmmaking, and education and community outreach.  To expand our range of operations while simultaneously controlling costs, we have been developing a towable Launch, Retrieval, and Transport (LRT) system that will allow us to access more near-shore dive sites without the need for expensive support vessels.  We tested our first prototype in Southern California last fall, and we are currently developing the next version out of our headquarters in Seattle.  We plan to field-test this next system in Florida during early 2012, so this presentation will provide an update on our efforts and our future plans.

A major obstacle in the development of manned submersibles involves the removal of metabolically-produced carbon dioxide from the cabin environment, particularly during long-duration, cold water operations.  Traditional CO2 absorption methods utilized in underwater life support systems use alkali metal hydroxide chemical beds—mostly calcium hydroxide—which have been shown to have poor absorption efficiencies in cold environments.  Experimental evidence suggests that seawater, a readily accessible medium during submersible operations, could be a highly effective alternative scrubbing medium to remove metabolically-produced carbon dioxide.  Laboratory CO2 absorption trials are currently being conducted in a joint research effort between Duke University and the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, under sponsorship by the Office of Naval Research.  An overview of these absorption trials will be presented and the physical principles governing this absorption technique will be explained.   Alternative concept designs will be introduced and the suitability of these concepts for open and closed-circuit breathing systems will be discussed.

Subsea power has long been identified as a challenging component of designing and operating underwater equipment. There is a continuous demand for reliable energy sources that allows equipment to run for longer, operate at deeper depths, and offer enhanced performance.

This presentation will outline the challenges of subsea power and describe the benefits of modular pressure-tolerant batteries. It will also highlight how this type of battery can effectively be used to supply power for a multitude of subsea applications such as AUVs, ROVs, benthic instrumentation and actuation of subsea equipment.

The talk will describe the characteristics of the underlying technology, the design methodology and historical development and the characteristics of pressure-tolerant batteries ranging from small replaceable units (1.5kWh / 30V) to larger units (29.6kWh /  240V). Field data of the battery performance in AUVs and possibly other platforms will also be presented.

Additionally, a new method of achieving safer performance of lithium-based battery packs will be presented. The method essentially prevents the propagation of fire among cells within a pack effectively yielding a safer energy supply. Recent research was conducted that included testing of fundamentally safer cells that shut down following an unsafe event. Results from this research will be shared.

ABSTRACT:  Large, modularly constructed Li-Ion and Li-Polymer battery systems are now being constructed for manned under water vehicles.  A significant advantage of modular construction of large battery systems is the maintainability of the battery system and the economic edge gained by repairing a large battery system using a single, relatively inexpensive, replacement battery module.  Battery system modularity also provides an easy path to improved reliability and safety via redundancy.
	The presentation will describe the architecture of a 240 Volt, 58 KWh battery system constructed using 64 identical, autonomous battery modules that provide as much as 8X redundancy.  A list of continuously available normal and fault status for a module is described.  A consol display of this operational status for all 64 modules and of the overall system is provided.
	Both standard and state-of-the-art advances for operation, maintenance, and safety of the battery system will be described.  Significant among the state-of-the-art advances are:

1)  A fast, safe, & automatic, module balancing method for supporting module replacement that is typically 100X faster than conventional methods;
2)  Two means for determining module State Of Health;
3)  An innovative means for timely detection of internal shorts within any cell in the battery system; and
4)  Ability to extend battery life and improve safety by automatically adjusting the charge level of all the modules within the battery system.

	The presentation will also describe a means of packaging the 64 modules that allow for pressure equalization of the modules, for mounting the battery external to the manned compartment, and that subdivide the battery system into sections that can be jettisoned.

PRESENTATION BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  This presentation provides an overview of a modularly constructed 240 Volt 58 KWh Li-Polymer battery system for a manned deep submergence vehicle.  Architecture, operation, maintenance, and safety features of the battery system are provided.  An innovative method for rapid module replacement with immediate system availability is described.  Two new means for detection of battery module State Of Health is described and an automatic means for detection of cell internal shorts is described.  A means to extend battery life and safety using module charge control is described.  Packaging of the pressure equalized battery modules and battery system is described.

Traditionally, naval architecture has been more craft than science. Determining what is ‘right’ in a particular situation in the absence of definitive supporting analysis encompasses the art of naval architecture to this day.  With the advent of computers, naval architects began to move their work from ‘the drawing board’ into the computer and its display.  This presentation describes the evolution of computer-based naval architecture tools from the early stages circa 1980 through the present, from the point of view of a team that pioneered tools which gained a diverse user community over that time frame.  This team’s story reflects progress and successes as well as continuing opportunities for advancement. Technical domains such as hull form design, hydrostatics and stability, structures, and weights and moments will be included, with applications to underwater vehicles discussed.  Technology developments related to software architecture and development processes will be highlighted, as well as a view toward future opportunities to further integrate and extend the scope of marine vehicle design tools.
