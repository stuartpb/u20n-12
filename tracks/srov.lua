Our agency was contacted by the Holmes County Sheriff's Office after all other efforts failed to locate the remains of a cave diver who reportedly failed to return to the surface after a deep cave penetration dive into Vortex Springs.

Before we left to assist with our Pro 4 ROV we were told that the missing diver was believed to be deep in the cave (approx 1,400 feet), in an area where the diameter of the tube where the diver was thought to be was equal to the size of the diver. Before our arrival experienced cave divers had searched the inside of the cave, and penetrated approx 1,200 feet into the cave. It was hoped that the ROV could reach an additional 200 feet, which was the limit of the mapped system. This area of the cave was not much larger that the ROV itself, and the ROV, or any diver reaching this point would not be able to turn around to exit the cave.

Unfortunately we were not able to locate the lost diver, but this presentation will review the challenges we encountered using an ROV in these most difficult circumstances, in a rarely attempted type of search and recovery mission. I will also talk about the equipment used during this attempted recovery, the support supplied by Video Ray, and the lessons learned during the mission.

While underwater operations provide a host of significant anxieties, when a sheet of ice is added to the picture the pressure increases similar to a diver descending down the water column.  Past practice - putting human life in jeopardy by traversing unsafe ice conditions or by placing divers into a confined space is no longer advisable.  Micro-ROV technology allows first responders to locate, inspect, and retrieve rapidly, efficiently, safely, and cost-effectively.  The requirement of cutting large holes for under ice diving creates future public hazards until solid freeze up occurs.   The extremely small hole required of the Micro-ROV minimizes vulnerability and can easily be made safe upon completion of the task.
The Micro-ROV is easily deployed, with minimal risk, into a potential human trap eliminating travel to the unknown.  The Micro-ROV can without difficulty, assess hazards, survey the scene, locate and identify targets, recover evidence and provide a safe lane of travel for a diver.  It doesn’t matter if it is an object that has fallen through or a survey that needs to be done; the employment of Micro-ROV under ice operation is a safe first alternative.
This presentation will show the experiences of several small ROV projects successfully employed in under-ice operations, along with lessons learned from the agencies involved.  Projects include locating vehicles fallen through the ice, drowning victims and ice rescue training.

The mission of Rozalia Project for a Clean Ocean is to find and remove marine debris from our oceans, bays and rivers. Marine debris takes many forms, and occurs in all marine environments, presenting myriad challenges in removing it from the water. Rachael Miller of Rozalia Project uses a VideoRay with BlueView sonar, Lyyn image enhancement, and Smart Tether positioning system along with the Tritech Starfish side scan sonar, to scour the bottom of a variety of venues looking for and retrieving marine debris - from small pieces of plastic to large masses of derelict fishing gear - and everything in-between. This presentation will show specific examples of how the equipment is integrated and used in concert to locate and recover a variety of objects of differing size and material, and how different benthic environments and conditions affect mission planning and execution. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of lessons learned and the strategies Rachael used to handle specific challenges related to debris search and recovery.

Shibuya Diving Industry (http://www.shibuya-diving.co.jp) is one of Japan’s most innovative, high technology companies.  Founder Mr. Masanobu Shibuya, has lead Japan’s diving evolution in many ways – particularly in protecting the environment, and underwater backhoe work in constructing port facilities.  In addition to leading the company, Mr. Shibuya is an expert underwater photographer and videographer, who is more often in the water  than topside when on site.

Since the Tsunami of March 11th, Shibuya Diving Industry has worked tirelessly to clear and reconstruct port facilities that have been devastated by buildings, cars, people – entire villages washed into the sea.  While every available diver worked around the clock, any technology that could help was needed.

After attending multiple Underwater Intervention conferences – and paying close attention to the technical presentations on small ROVs – Mr. Shibuya placed an order for a VideoRay Pro 4 system with multibeam sonar, non-acoustic positioning, and radiation sensor along with other accessories.  In addition to the hardware, Shibuya Diving Industry purchased factory training, with VideoRay trainers spending a week in Japan explaining, demonstrating, and teaching Shibuya’s staff how microROVs can be used along with divers to make projects saver, faster, and more efficient.

This presentation by Mr. Shibuya himself will explain the results he experienced with the equipment and the lessons he has learned since acquiring it.

Remotely Operated Vehicles were used during two trips to the Tsunami damaged areas in the Iwate Prefecture of Japan. In April 2011 four ROV’s were used to inspect infrastructure and to assist with victim search and recovery.  The ROV’s successfully allowed a fishing port to be reopened and were used to search for victims in debris to dangerous for manual search with divers. During this trip a SeaBotix SARbot, a SeaBotix LBV-300-5, a SeaMor ROV and an AC-ROV were used. A second trip in October 2011 saw a return to the city of Minamisanriku Cho. The city had requested an expanded search for debris in the ports and open areas of the bay where fishing nets were to be redeployed. Based on lessons learned in April a SeaBotix SARbot was chosen.  This paper will present data and lessons learned from the two trips.

The low-logistics associated with microROVs make it an ideal platform for rapid deployment. With microROVs, first respondents are able to rapidly mobilize to an area, run a survey and interact with the subsea environment if required. The time it takes to run a search and the confidence to report that the area has been cleared is often time-crucial for the success of the mission. Recent advances in technology have seen the introduction of software solutions to automate and simplify the piloting of the ROV by analyzing data gathered from navigation and sonar sensors.  Over the last few years technology developments have reduced the size of these sensors and it is now possible to introduce some of the technologies in use with observation-class and work-class ROVs. This talk explores a solution that integrates a phased array Doppler Velocity Log with a microROV and enables a true survey capability that, to date, would normally only be found with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. The Survey-Control software simplifies the piloting of ROVs, improves the situational awareness of the operator and increases the pace of operations.  With this tool, first respondents will be able to fly the ROV with significantly less training and guide the ROV precisely around the environment.

Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) fill different niches within the underwater intervention task spectrum.  AUVs provide the capability for subsea inspection and survey on a variety of range scales and with multiple sensors, including sidescan and synthetic aperture sonar, sub-bottom profiling, multi-beam echosounding and still and video photography.  Small ROVs can provide inspection, repair and maintenance capabilities to assist the oil and gas industries in deep water environments.
Bluefin Robotics recently acquired the assets of Hawkes Remotes, Inc. (HRI), a spinoff from Hawkes Ocean Technologies (HOT) that develops advanced ROVs.  The HRI designs offer scalable, modular solutions including a thin, armored fiber-optic tether and on-board high-energy-density batteries that will reduce the total cost of ownership/operating costs while simultaneously outperforming existing ROV technology.  Bluefin will leverage their autonomy and subsea experience to add hybrid capabilities to the ROVs and offer them as an extension of their current product line to the oil and gas industry.  The presentation will show how the Bluefin/Hawkes capabilities in the AUV and ROV space provide complementary technologies that will enable a wide variety of underwater intervention tasks with a cost-effective footprint and low infrastructure support.

The Institute of Marine Technology Problems (IMPT) is a unit of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It was formed as the Navigation and Control Systems Lab in 1972 and in 1988 grown into the IMPT with an emphasis on research, development and engineering of AUVs. In an almost 40 years of establishment, the IMPT has been successful in developing dozens of unmanned underwater vehicles (prototypes and initial production).

Although the Institute  is not an educational establishment there are several students from local colleges and universities who are pursuing their Bachelor's, Master's and PhD degrees.

Since 2008, teams of students from IMPT have participated in the MATE ROV Competition. In 2010 they won. This paper will present how the student ROV innovations were transformed into commercial product and why students involved in MATE are in demand in the underwater engineering workplace. Theoretical approaches in developing underwater vehicles, practical construction work and sea trials will be described in this presentation giving useful insight to students, teachers, and underwater technology professionals.

In order to quantify the effect of biofouling on ship performance, an accurate measure must be made of the fouling on the ship. This biofouling is very dependent on timing and ship service. Inspections must be carried out immediately after a ship’s return, and before a deployment. Not only are multiple, repeatable points to be inspected on the ship, but the ability must exist to do so anywhere in the world and on short notice. Both divers and ROVs were utilized to accomplish this mission.
By utilizing both divers and ROVs, NSWC Carderock Division has been able to provide a consistent, high-quality survey of Navy ship hulls to meet the goals of the experiment. The lessons learned from over 60 hull inspections in two years will be shared. These include comments on rapid response, ship tagouts, ruggedization for air shipment of systems, and a novel CONOP for small-footprint operation on a pier. Divers and ROVs need not be competitors. By playing to the strengths of both, a much better product can be produced, and vital data can be gathered that would otherwise be missed.

During the summer of 2011, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals was contracted by Saudi ARAMCO to conduct  an extensive surveys in the Red Sea where they wanted to conduct test drills for oil.  The survey was needed to complete a baseline assessment and to see if there were any critical habitat areas in or near the proposed well sights.
This presentation will cover the highlights and triumphs of a very ambitious expedition.
Some of the requirements for the tasking were an extremely tight work schedule, limited support facilities, accurate positioning for data collection and very specific data gathering.  Additionally, all of the work had to be conducted off of a 25’ Boston Whaler.
Due to these stringent requirements a VideoRay Pro4 ROV, KCF Technologies Smart Tether, LYYN Video Enhancement System and a YSI 600XL Sonde Gauge were chosen to complete the survey.

The use of VideoRays in the Offshore Oil & Gas Industry is growing rapidly, as recent results of inspections of facilities and vessels around the world show that this is compelling technology. Inspections can often be done more rapidly, efficiently, safely, and at lower cost than other traditional methods. In many cases there are critical areas and mechanisms that cannot be inspected safely by ANY other method. The extreme portability, small size, low power consumption of modern micro ROVs combined with their depth, current handling, and tether pulling capabilities combine to provide completely new tactics, techniques, and procedures.

This presentation covers case studies where Van Meter Consulting has used Micro ROVs to support offshore oil and gas projects. From Russia's Siberian LNG, to an FPSO in the South China Sea, to the Gulf of Mexico, photos and video clips will demonstrate how this maturing technology is being used in the offshore environment. Van Meter will explain how he won the jobs, planned for the mission, adjusted and compensated when things were not working, and successfully completed the mission each time.

Multibeam imaging sonars have been available since the early nineties and have served well as a tool to improve situational awareness. Operators can observe targets at distances of tens to hundreds of yards and use the information to navigate underwater vehicles and monitor important subsea regions. The original systems were significant in size and weight and required large electronic pods to beam form and process the raw data. But today’s multibeam imaging sonars are of a size suitable for microROV operation, so much so that they have become a common payload option for many operators. In tandem software solutions enabling close control of unmanned systems using through-the-sensor servoing techniques have evolved to a level of maturity suitable for commercial exploitation. The bringing together of this technology with the microROV will enable a new level of user control to the operational users. A common task such as flying to a target can be a difficult undertaking when faced with currents and tether effects, when time is at a premium this can be frustrating and negatively impact the overall mission needs. This proposed technology enables the microROV to keep station relative to an object or structure identified in the sonar data. The ROV can then maneuver relative to this object and the pilot need only provide simple point-and-click commands on the sonar screen. This talk will illustrate some early results on early prototype work.

The key to successful underwater vision is to get rid of the water! This cliché is as old as underwater photography itself, but it's still true today. Depth, distance, lighting, turbidity of the water, salinity, and pollution all contribute to the visibility, and the perception of size, shape, and color of underwater objects.

The LYYN products optimize the contrast and color of each frame to increase the visibility of a scene. Even the smallest fragments of color and object shape can be extracted from the camera sensor to restore the scene as much as possible. And all this is done in real-time. The result is an image that constantly self-adjusts to the environment and the diver or ROV pilot can focus on mission objectives.

Until now, this technology has only been available for analog video. In the near future, it will be available also for HD-SDI video streams and for IP cameras. During the presentation we will demonstrate how we eliminate both the disturbances from water as well as the distance to the camera by connecting an iPad to several IP cameras live from around the world, and enhancing the video in real-time. We will also show some recorded, and lyynified HD footage.

Excavating and recovering ancient artefacts from the seabed demands precise and highly reliable equipment.  Florida-based RPM Nautical Foundation (RPMNF) has pushed the boundaries of maritime archaeology by performing the careful and precise work necessary for professional archaeology at depths beyond effective diver range.

To accomplish these goals, RPMNF uses an ROV fitted with two Hydro-lek multifunctional manipulator arms, most recently in the Egadi Islands off Sicily where they discovered warship rams that date back to the 3rd century BC.

This paper will provide an overview of how these Hydro-Lek manipulators were utilized in the recovery of not just these important archaeological artefacts but also in many other deep sea salvage operations.  It will also explain the design and operation of the hydraulic manipulator technology and how smaller ROV's can be empowered by the use of high performance subsea tooling.

Florida State University Panama City (FSUPC) completed an evaluation study in 2010 that examined the techniques and tools available for the execution of the search and inspection activities that public safety divers are routinely called upon to perform.  The test teams were drawn from major ports across the country and were selected for their experience and skill in conducting port security operations as well as routine public safety dive functions.  The teams included Seattle Police Department Harbor Patrol, NYPD Scuba Team, Jacksonville Sheriff Office Dive Team, and the FBI’s USERT team out of Los Angeles. A team from FSUPC’s Underwater Crime Scene Investigation was utilized to augment the dataset.  The findings indicated that traditional and technology-augmented search techniques were all very successful methods, particularly in the specific contexts for which they were developed.  However, broader implications to ROV training and use were suggested by the results.  While these observations were beyond the scope of the study, they provide valuable insights that are shared in this paper.

Remotely operated vehicles have become a commonplace undersea tool.  However there are still people pushing the boundaries of technological development and finding new ways to repurpose current technology to new tasks.
The micro-ROV lends itself to non-traditional use more so than its bigger brethren.  The lower cost, lower complexity, and ease of transportation and operational insertion promote novel uses and experimentation.  The micro-ROV also packs many capabilities into a systems package: imaging and navigation sensors, propulsion, illumination, pressure vessel, power, communications, etc.
This talk will discuss some examples of such non-traditional uses by VideoRay customers and ways in which manufactures can foster and leverage this type of end-user application.
