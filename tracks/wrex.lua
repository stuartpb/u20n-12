### USS Houston ###

Dave Phillips will explain the challenges faced while diving in high current with dangers above and below the surface on the USS HOUSTON, sunk during WWII off the coast of Indonesia. The goal of the team has been to preserve the memory of this World War II battle by documenting the Houston with video and sonar images as this vessel is slowly being claimed by the sea. During multiple trips, expedition members treat the wreck site with the dignity and sanctity deserved, and have worked closely with surviving USS Houston sailors and family members. VideoRay has been a strong partner and sponsor in making these missions to the Houston possible.

### M/V Princess of the Stars ###

David Phillips travelled to the Philippines in 2008 to work with Titan Salvage Company on salvage efforts for a major ferry tragedy. The M/V Princess of the Stars, carrying several hundred people tragically capsized during a major typhoon leaving only a handful of survivors. During this salvage, VideoRay played a part in the early assessment and overview of the wreck. David will present footage of this wreck as case study for melding use of VideoRay ROVs into commercial salvage and other industrial applications.

In this talk we present a comprehensive survey procedure developed in-house and deployed on a recent survey mission in Mount Hope Bay to locate two ship wreckages using an Iver2. The vehicles were equipped with a Klein Side Scan Sonar, an Imagenex Delta-T multi-beam sensor and a Sontec Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) sensor. We present details on the in water compass calibration procedure that was developed using an Extended Kalman Filtering approach.   In addition, details on mission specification, localization including slant range correction and logging of multi-beam and side-scan sonar data are also presented. The multi-beam and side-scan data are prost-processed for automatic as well as manual artifact identification. Some sample results are also presented. We envision this comprehensive approach to be adopted for  multiple applications such as SLAM, hydrographic survey and underwater inspection missions.
