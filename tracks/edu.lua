The MATE Center provides an outlet for students of all ages to build and test Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). MATE Center goes through great lengths to plan and simulate ‘real-world’ problems as the basis for their competitions. From submarine search and rescue operations to underwater sea mount exploration and, more recently, oil spill containment, the competitions attempt to simulate reality.

Georgia Tech Savannah Robotics’ ROV Beta Mk II is a direct product of the MATE competition. This vehicle was featured in a summer research trip to the Louisiana Gulf Coast to search for remnants of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The same system originally developed for competition collected water samples for oil content analysis at the Gulf Coast site.

This year, Beta Mk II is slated to survey recently unearthed Revolutionary War shipwrecks off the coast of Yorktown, VA. For 2012, the MATE ROV Competition again aligns with the real world research plan for the vehicle. This talk will outline the competition influences on design, the differences in real world performance vs. competition, and the future work inspired by the competition.

Robotics plays an increasing role in STEM education.   It provides for a systems level curricula which encompasses and integrates many disciplines:  mathematics, mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, and domain specific problem solving.     Adding the aspect of underwater exploration to the story makes the use of robotics even more compelling as a driver of improvements to STEM education.  The unique scientific component of underwater exploration allows for the combination of non-engineering scientific elements such biology, geology, oceanography and even archeology.
The commercial micro ROV provides benefits as an educational tool.   The primary benefits being ease of use and logistics, relative low cost, multiplicity of roles, and system completeness.   The microROV also enables a continuum of development which synchronizes well with other popular STEM efforts.
This talk will discuss some of the ways in which VideoRay fosters undersea robotics in educational roles.   The applicability to students in various stages of development from k-12 to post-graduate will be discussed.   Suggestions on ways other commercial organizations can more proactively support improvements to STEM education will be covered.

The SENSE IT project provides high school students the opportunity to build, calibrate and test a set of sensors and circuits, to measure a variety of physical quantities. To build and understand their sensors, student use a wide range of core knowledge of mathematics and physical science, as well as learning practical technology skills such as soldering and debugging circuits. Then students interface their sensors with computers, write programs to gather raw signals from the sensors, implement calibration curves, and perform data manipulation and data logging. Students then program their own communications protocols for wireless data transmission and connect their computerized sensor stations together to form a distributed wireless sensor network.

SENSE IT promotes student awareness of the interdisciplinary nature of modern engineering and the interdependence of diverse areas of science and math. The theme of environmental stewardship and sensor systems provides: 1) a motivating and meaningful scenario for learning a wide range of core math, science and technology topics, 2) an engaging link between biological, physical and social sciences and 3) a cutting-edge example of science and engineering research, delivered directly into the classroom in a particular area of growing importance and workforce need.

The Great Lakes Naval Memorial and Museum (GLNMM) has developed a program that utilizes ROV kits and a professional build ROV to promote STEM based education for all ages. These programs utilize underwater technology to provide educational activities that promote a greater understanding of the underwater environment through direct interaction. The technology used in these programs are small underwater robots referred to as remotely operated vehicles or ROVs. These ROVs can be created, designed and build by students or other program participants such as teachers. GLNMM has created a traveling educational outreach program that includes classes of different lengths and levels for people of all ages and backgrounds. These classes can be offered at locations throughout the region and include two separate experiences. The first experience is creating and building a ROV that the participants can use to explore the underwater environment. The second part is the opportunity to drive a professionally build ROV to explore underwater to depths of several hundred feet. Most dives are in only in depths of fifty feet or less. This technology allows the participants an experience similar to being a SCUBA diver.

Jesuit High School successfully completed missions designed by the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center to cap a flowing oil well and assess environmental damage, simulating the challenges that BP encountered in the gulf oil spill.  The MATE Center holds an annual ROV competition and hosts high school, college, and university teams from around the world.  The 2011 competition was held at the NASA Neutral Buoyancy Lab in Houston, Texas, adding the challenge of withstanding a depth of 40 feet.  The Jesuit High School Robotics Team, with a budget of $15,000 and a schedule of 20 workdays, manufactured the winning ROV with modular accessories specifically designed for each task, Ethernet communications, and a vectored control system.  This presentation will provide an overview of the ROV, including the design process, control system, accessories, and potential full scale applications.

    abstract = [==[
For 10 years, the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center’s international ROV competition program has challenged students to think creatively, work as part of a team, and apply technical skills in new and innovative ways.

However, in 2011 the Center took a new approach to encouraging students to develop 21st century workplace skills.  Instead of teams, MATE asked students to think of themselves as entrepreneurs and to form “companies” instead of “teams.”  We challenged them to develop an understanding of the breadth of business operations and to structure their company with the appropriate personnel – from CEOs to CFOs, Software Engineers to Marketing Directors,  Operations Managers to PR Specialists.  Not only were they expected to design, build, and perform, their “product,” they also had to sell it to their client – in this case, the MATE Center and the industry professionals who volunteer as competition judges.

The response was positive – and powerful!  Students and mentors took the challenge very seriously.  They came up with creative names for their companies and, in some cases, developed a company logo.  They identified the positions necessary for a business to run successfully and assigned students to those roles.  They created business cards and marketing materials that described their company and product line.  (One company developed an “app” that is available for download on the iTunes store.)  They wore suits and ties during their engineering presentations.  They gave cost and delivery estimates for their product and, if they had competed before, their record of past performance.

Based on this success, the MATE competition will continue its entrepreneurial approach and add to it in 2012.  For example, in order to reach out to and further engage students with an interest in technology but an aptitude in the arts, MATE will ask companies to develop PR “kits” and put them into practice by targeting their local media.

In an effort to provide realistic educational experiences for students, the MATE Center works closely with marine industry professionals to develop ROV competition mission tasks that model real world scenarios.  The goal of the MATE Center missions is to present challenges students might experience in the field and familiarize them with another aspect of the underwater industry.

The 2012 mission theme deals with 20th century shipwrecks and their potential environmental threats.    Working with the Professional Marine Explorers Society, the MATE Center is developing tasks that include surveying the wreck and removing fuel from a corroding tank.  Replicating this complex problem involves creating mission props that are designed with inexpensive hardware store technology, allowing teams around the world to copy MATE Center designs.  Underwater missions also take place in a pool environment, with clear, warm water, generally less than 6 meters deep.  Working within these limitations, the MATE Center mission tasks model real world events that students might experience in the underwater industry.
