Technical innovations are occurring at an ever-increasing rate and create new challenges for both government and industry engineers to take advantage and transition new technology to meet their operational and business needs. Finding rapid technology transition and product development processes that can keep pace with technological innovations is key to bringing the best technology to our customers. To this end, the Naval Surface Warfare Center's Panama City Division has created a special laboratory for unmanned systems experimentation, prototyping and technology transition that is seeking to rapidly develop innovative applications of new and existing technology in modular forms in order to bring new operational concepts to life in much shorter timeframes than normal system development processes.
This presentation will cover the initial efforts of this laboratory to develop new innovative Operational Concepts for Explosive Ordnance Disposal forces, Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) forces, and Maritime Critical Infrastructure Protection using modular, Micro Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) technology. The presentation will focus on processes for creating modular hardware and software architectures, conducting important experiments in the operational environment, and finding or developing new technologies that open up new possibilities for innovative changes to operational concepts or market segments.

Metal parts hate water, especially salt water. Add the effects of depth pressure and the rough operating conditions often experienced in the field and the marine parts designer faces unique and difficult challenges.  Frequently plastic is the answer.  Advances in plastic materials and manufacturing processes make that increasingly the case.  Plastic neither rusts nor corrodes, can be as tough as metal, is lightweight, has no magnetic signature, and can be formed into a wide variety of shapes.  Plastic parts can be designed to withstand extreme depth pressures, to minimize or eliminate leak paths, not to outgas, and for specific underwater signal reflection, transmission, or attenuation characteristics.  Plastic can be used to encapsulate delicate electronics, GPS modules, antennae, and power connectors.  This presentation provides an overview of the present state of the art in plastics materials and manufacturing processes for undersea applications and highlights particularly difficult missions where plastic parts have been critical to success.  Highlighted missions include:

- AUVs discovering Air France 447 wreckage 2 Â½ miles down in the Atlantic
- Combat divers mapping a harbor minefield
- Navy SEALS conducting  underwater special ops
- In-situ instruments monitoring ocean conditions for weather forecasting and climate modeling
- ROVs working on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico

For over thirty years, Polymer Corporation has been a leading producer of high-performance plastic parts and assemblies for undersea use.

There is increasing pressure from government, industry and the public to protect the environment. Many underwater projects require the use of environmentally preferable, biodegradable products to bid for contracts. While initially more expensive, these fluids can save money and time when properly utilized. They can improve equipment performance, while protecting the user from costly fines and clean up in the event of a leak or spill.

Environmentally safe lubricants will be presented from a 'hands-on' perspective. The paper will review spills and response regulations. It will also cover major organizational and commercial initiatives that are the major driving forces behind their use.

The paper will explore the types of biodegradable products and how they interact with underwater equipment. Included will be their compatibility with hydraulics, pumps, sealing materials, hoses, and other important components. Water infiltration, high pressure, wide temperature range usage as well as ways to manage these challenges will also be discussed.

There will be a discussion of specific maintenance practices that are required to maintain long useful life of these fluids as well as long equipment life. This will include real world experience gained by several successful long term field demonstrations with commercial and military divers and ROVs. Data that will be used covers oil analysis, equipment inspections, operating conditions, and overall cost savings.

The world ocean remains the last unexplored space on earth. Underwater robots, when massively deployed, can bring huge benefit. Their use, however, is much more complicated than aerial or ground ones, due to communication problems. That is why enhancing intelligence of individual robots for increasing autonomy and reducing communications is the primary goal. In this paper we are offering a high-level distributed control technology that can dynamically integrate any underwater units into operable teams with a sort of global consciousness and pursuing global goals. It is based on universal knowledge processing and control modules easily installed in units and communicating with each other via any available channels. Ad hoc networks of these modules spatially, in parallel, interpret global mission descriptions in a special high-level Distributed Scenario Language (DSL) reflecting top semantics of what to be done in a distributed maritime space, while leaving system structuring and task-oriented C2 entirely to automatic language interpretation.  Extremely  short, created on the fly, DSL scenarios are injected into the robotic swarm from any unit, subsequently covering the whole system and setting the needed behavior, with communications between vehicles much shorter than with any other approaches (thus suitable for low speed channels). Implementation details of the technology will be revealed, and exemplary scenarios in DSL related to underwater environments, like collective distributed search of a large territory for specific objects or patrolling coastline will be shown. Cooperation with surface and aerial vehicles, also with higher-level manned systems within the same organizational model, are discussed too.

"AUVs are ideal platforms for carrying an array of sensors for monitoring the environment around offshore installations. Combined with subsea docking technology, AUVs equipped with environmental sensors provide a persistent early warning capability against oil and gas leaks from drilling operations and pipelines, or other environmental contaminants. Acoustics is emerging as an alternative method of indirectly (or directly) detecting hydrocarbons in the water column. Kongsberg sonars are at the forefront of this developing technology which has also been adapted for AUV application. Its fisheries echo sounders have been used extensively in recent years for detecting and tracking oil plumes resulting from subsea leaks.

Kongsberg's AUVs combine the latest in sonar technology, hydrocarbon sensors (Ã¢â¬ÅsniffersÃ¢â¬Â) and other chemical sensors to provide a full suite of environmental sensors on a long endurance, autonomous and low-logistics subsea platform. Our host of in-house AUV technologies enables a reliable and capable environmental monitoring and warning tool and includes subsea docking, through-moonpool launch and recovery, platform hovering and adaptive behaviors. Kongsberg AUVs are also fully modular in design, allowing operators to configure a vehicle to suit the task at hand.

This paper provides a technology update on Kongsberg's AUVs for environmental monitoring and presents recent test results for key technologies, including detecting hydrocarbons with acoustical sensors."

The Surface or Subsea Data Logger is intended to give operators the ability to monitor key pressures and provide information in real-time.

The Surface Data Logger is specifically designed to capture pressure (P) vs. a set time (T) on a chart recorder or data-logger at high resolution. The test equipment is connected between a hydraulic supply and the equipment to be tested. While operating the equipment, pressure vs. time is recorded on a suitably scaled chart recorder or data-logger. The newly captured chart is compared against known good data. The performance curves are then interpreted to determine if the equipment is operating within an acceptable range. With the Data Logger information, one can determine if the equipment is operating as designed.

The Subsea Data Logger, equipment to record pressures and other data on the BOP Stack while subsea is independent of existing control pods and the data is accessible on the surface. The Subsea Data Logger units can be daisy-chained and placed on the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) and/or lower stack. The Data Logger's battery power source is good for long durations without a recharge. These batteries can be recharged subsea via ROV.  The data is multi-plexed onto a single mode fiber. The on board computer records data from up to 8 analog channels concurrently at a high data rate (up to 250,000 X 8 samples per second). ROV interface is provided for separate communications path to the unit.

Typical use for the Data Logger for Surface and/or Subsea:

- Factory acceptance testing of RAM BOPs, annulars, connectors, valves, BOP stacks and trees
- On-hire acceptance testing of production and offshore drilling rigs
- Pre-deployment testing of trees and BOP stacks following repairs and maintenance
- Before and after maintenance
- To justify an extended maintenance period

    lead = "Chris Hancock",
    abstract = [==[
HUGIN and REMUS AUVs use advanced feature recognition algorithms, developed originally for mine-detection, to track subsea pipelines directly in sonar data in real time. This, combined with sensors such as multibeam echo sounder and high-resolution still camera, enables inspection of pipelines at a considerably higher speed, and thus lower cost, than traditional methods, while producing higher quality data. Kongsberg Maritimeâs unique way of performing pipeline inspection with AUV involves two fully-autonomous passes along a pipeline. The first pass is run off to the side, and by using either high-resolution interferometric synthetic aperture sonar (HISAS) or conventional side scan sonar (SSS), a wide swath around the pipeline is mapped as the AUV automatically tracks the pipeline directly from the sonar data. This way, the pipelineâs actual position is determined and knowledge is gained about surrounding threats like anchors and trawling activity in a wide swath of up more than 200 meters.

The second pass is run directly over the pipeline at a low altitude, and accurate inspection data is collected with multibeam echo sounder and camera. By using high-resolution still camera and mosaic techniques, one avoids the massive over-sampling resulting from use of video-cameras, which makes data management easier. The still camera pictures are automatically and accurately geo-referenced in the AUV, removing the need for the time-consuming task of matching up video with ROV positioning data. Another significant cost reduction stems from the elimination of the support vessel normally used in traditional pipeline inspection with ROV.

In cases where a priori data about the pipelineâs position is poor, and where the pipeline may be partially buried, this concept exploits the wide swath afforded by the HISAS by increasing tracking robustness and reducing the need for lateral search patterns to reacquire partially buried pipelines.

In the fall of 2011, Kongsberg Maritime has integrated automatic tracking of pipelines directly from the multibeam echo sounder data, thereby adding an important capability in the toolbox available to the AUV operator. In cases where it is appropriate, this can remove the need for the first survey pass, and gives the operator more flexibility in how to design the inspection mission. This paper highlights recent test results from industry-funded technology demonstration trials conducted along pipelines in the North Sea.
