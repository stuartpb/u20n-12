This presentation will cover new technologies available to divers in commercial, military or scientific roles that will provide them with more capabilities, and a safer work environment.

Off the shelf technology now exists to give divers the ability to see and work in zero visibility, detect and track buried objects, accurately navigate over large distances, inspect structures, as well as gather accurate bathymetric / hydrographic data.

This presentation will present an overview of these new technologies and provide examples of how they can be used by different types of divers to offer new services, as well as make existing jobs safer and more efficient.

This Presentation will deal with the following examples:

Commercial Diving;
Buried pipe and cable tracking, Structural inspections, searches

Military Diving
MCM operations, Rapid beach profiling, covert operations, SAR operations

Scientific diving
Archaeological mapping, bathymetry

Law Enforcement
SAR operations, Crime scene investigations

American Electric Power, a Sustaining Member of ADCI, continues to conduct training of its employees in the rules and regulations of commercial diving via OSHA, US Coast Guard and the ADCI Consensus Standards.  Training programs are conducted each year at selected AEP facilities for new students and re-qualifying Diving Contacts.  Criteria for becoming a Diving Contact at AEP is delineated in their program and requires each person to be nominated by management, complete the program and a written examination.  They serve in the program for a period of three years and must re-qualify by attending refresher training.  An AEP Diving Contact works directly with diving contractors at any AEP facility.  They are familiar with all diving regulations and the Consensus Standards, including Rev. 6, and can work the diving tables for repetitive dives, surface decompression on air or oxygen for example. Since they understand parts of our industry; they really make it easier for a diving contractor to communicate with them.  Dave Scarberry has been their Diving Coordinator and the originator of their program since inception and is responsible for its development and administration.  Will Hux is the instructor from MESCO/ Stroud Diving & Hydrography and wrote the training curriculum for the classroom portion of the training.  They make a strong team in presenting a safety program of which is an industry first.

While it has been common industry practice to rely on hand written dive logs for divers and chamber runs for decompression, we have to rely completely on the integrity, quality, and capability of the human element to make detailed time and data entries without errors and while possibly being distracted by a great many things on deck.  Our company has been using electronic recorders and pressure sensors on chambers for years but now there exists a small device which we've been testing and have in practice for years which we issue to each diver and place in each of our chambers.  It records the time, depth, and temperature of the entire dive including the rates of ascent and descent.  They are a remarkable tool to counsel employees who violate descent and ascent rates or supervisors who allow surface intervals to go beyond the 5 minutes allowed between surfacing a diver and surface-decompression.

As a safety device, the recorders are completely indelible and the data is stored where it cannot be tampered with or changed.  They couple magnetically to upload data and there are no plugs or ports.  the only battery comes installed at the factory and they last approximately 10 years depending on usage.  These record chamber runs with precision and are completely intrinsic and sealed so there is no need to worry in an oxygen environment.  Testing is underway in our deep hyperbaric testing chamber to determine accuracy and integrity of its program and depth capability.

I hope to present this device and share the safe technology with all our members in January.

This presentation is aimed at highlighting the benefits of implementing a management system that integrates quality and safety to improve the overall operations and safety performance of a Diving organization.  Organizations that have an established quality management system enjoy higher levels of customer and employee satisfaction.  Employees feel empowered to contribute to the success of the system and also are able to make better decisions because the organizationâ€™s processes are in control.  But how can an organization achieve this level of operational excellence?

In this session we will answer the following questions:

1.	What is a Quality Management System and how does it relate to Safety?
2.	List of Diving companies throughout the world who operate under a Quality or Safety Management System certified to ISO 9001 and/or OHSAS 18001.
3.	10 Things Diving companies can do to get a Quality/Safety Management System off the ground.
4.	10 tangible benefits of implementing a quality/safety management system in a Diving organization.

Attendees will also receive a checklist at the end of the session that can be used to identify the gaps in their quality/safety management system within their organizations to determine areas that need further work in order to achieve full compliance.

Originally presented at the Transportation Research Board in January 2011.  This paper discusses systems and techniques that have been utilized to restore the structural integrity and protect concrete, steel, and woodpiles for more than 35 years. Many bridges in active use today are well beyond their intended designed life.  Since it would be much too costly and time consuming to replace these bridges with new bridges, proven repair and rehabilitation systems are critical to the life and safety of these structures. This paper will discuss the use of the FX-70 Inert Corrosion Free fiberglass jacket system that utilizes FX-70-6 Hydro-Ester Multipurpose Marine Epoxy and FX-225 Underwater Mortar specifically designed for bridge pile restoration.

In 1966-68 the author first discovered HPNS at 600 fsw and 800 fsw.  Amerlioration first proved possible by selection of less susceptible divers, a very slow compression rate and stages for adaptation, but something more was required for depths greater than 1,000 fsw.  The author developed TRIMIX (He/N2/O2) to prevent such HPNS.  Experimental dives were made from the 1970s to 1990s at Duke University Medical Center ending with 4 deep saturation dives leading to a record depth of 686 m (2,250 fsw).  These were then continued at the German Underwater Simulator (Hamburg). At first, there were 14 deep working dives (8 hours welding per day) breathing TRIMIX 5 with little or no HPNS to 600 m (2,150 ft).  Later, further TRIMIX 5 dives with a 13 man diver team and 2,662 man days of saturation and 983 days of successful welding at 450 m (1,440 fsw) were conducted, proving the success of TRIMIX 5 in prevention of HPNS with no long term effects.

Commercial Diving is instrumental to the offshore oil and construction industries, with thousands of hours spent sub surface every year. With this being said sickness and hyperbaric illness are a very real threat to all divers. This paper explores what care givers whom provide emergent health care to divers have available to aid in monitoring vital signs for the ill or injured patient. With the move into deeper waters and more demanding work the health and well being of a diver has become a top priority. Further the OGP has published guidelines requiring the ability to monitor the cardiac rhythm of a diver in a chamber. This paper will describe the problems and solutions to patient monitoring at depth.

The contributions of Northwest divers to the craft of commercial diving are significant. Divers have often modified standard helmets to suit their specific needs and, beginning in the 1930s and into the 1960s, Seattle area divers developed a very distinctive helmet with several advantages over the standard gear. The culmination of this design process was a swimmable diving helmet that, but for differing construction materials and lack of swim fins, remains quite comparable to the equipment worn by modern commercial divers. This is the story of the progression from the standard diving helmet design to what became known as the Northwest Modified Diving Helmet or, since it is often named for its major contributor, the McCray helmet.

The US Supreme Court ruling in Atlantic Sounding v Townsend and the cases that have followed over the last two years have turned previously allowed employee damage remedies upside down. Punitive damages have been allowed not only in unseaworthiness claims, but in loss of consortium claims as well. In virtually all aspects of commercial diving and vessel operations , there has been a steady expansion of employee rights that every marine contractor and vessel operator need to understand and plan for.
Bringing you over three decades of diving risk management and analysis,  six time Superlawyer Rick Lesser will provide a summary of the most current aspects of diving and maritime law that will be invaluable in making  your own analysis of the risks and potential legal problems facing you., and more importantly, how to deal with them.
Whether you are a commercial diver, vessel operator or diving contractor, the information in this seminar is vital to help you protect your business and your livelihood.

When the Diver Certification Board of Canada (DCBC) was conceived in 2001 divers asked that it be set up in such a way that DCBC certificates would be accepted anywhere in the world they wanted to work; divers wanted to carry just one certificate of professional competency.   The CEO of the DCBC travelled to the UK to confirm that the new Canadian certificates would continue to benefit from the international recognition that the National Energy Board certificates had received.

The Divers Institute of Technology in Seattle, Washington was the first US school to realize the benefit of international recognition of their diver training; they modified their training program and applied for accreditation by the DCBC in 2003.  Since then the Commercial Diving Academy in Jacksonville, Florida and the Minnesota Commercial Diving Training Center in Brainerd have also become accredited by the DCBC and Santa Barbara City College of Santa Barbara, California is just a few steps away from accreditation.  International recognition means that US graduates of those schools are certified to work almost anywhere in the world.

The paper will discuss the governance of the DCBC, the competency standard on which certification is based, the process to certify divers and the process to achieve accreditation.  The paper will also touch upon the work of the DCBC to retain and enhance their international recognition.

This subject will address a recent accident that occured to a diver while performing an underwater welding operation.  The resulting investigation and root cause analysis lead to the identification of several unrealized conditions that aided in creating this "perfect storm."  These included such items as unaccounted power sources, unfamiliar with tools, unknown actual amperage from welder, and adjacent work groups.  The end result was a new, and more detailed JHA was created that addresses these hazards.  This JHA includes all of the best safet practices as laid out by the ADCI, but also takes it to the next level of pre-job set ups, and a firm commitment by AEP on how all U/W buring and welding work will conducted across the entire fleet.
