This presentation will cover new technologies available to divers in commercial, military or scientific roles that will provide them with more capabilities, and a safer work environment.

Off the shelf technology now exists to give divers the ability to see and work in zero visibility, detect and track buried objects, accurately navigate over large distances, inspect structures, as well as gather accurate bathymetric / hydrographic data.

This presentation will present an overview of these new technologies and provide examples of how they can be used by different types of divers to offer new services, as well as make existing jobs safer and more efficient.

This Presentation will deal with the following examples:

Commercial Diving;
Buried pipe and cable tracking, Structural inspections, searches

Military Diving
MCM operations, Rapid beach profiling, covert operations, SAR operations

Scientific diving
Archaeological mapping, bathymetry

Law Enforcement
SAR operations, Crime scene investigations

Jim Garrington is the founder and president of Shark Marine Technologies Inc. a Canadian company that has been creating innovative underwater technologies since 1984. As a diver, Jim's approach to underwater technology was from the inside out, encountering a need and creating a solution. Jim has had extensive experience in many faucets of underwater  operations including archeaology, bathymetric surveys, pipe locating and tracking, ROV piloting, drowned victim recoveries, port security and military mine countermeasures. He has has trained both military and commercial divers around the globe in the use of new underwater detection and navigation technology.

American Electric Power, a Sustaining Member of ADCI, continues to conduct training of its employees in the rules and regulations of commercial diving via OSHA, US Coast Guard and the ADCI Consensus Standards.  Training programs are conducted each year at selected AEP facilities for new students and re-qualifying Diving Contacts.  Criteria for becoming a Diving Contact at AEP is delineated in their program and requires each person to be nominated by management, complete the program and a written examination.  They serve in the program for a period of three years and must re-qualify by attending refresher training.  An AEP Diving Contact works directly with diving contractors at any AEP facility.  They are familiar with all diving regulations and the Consensus Standards, including Rev. 6, and can work the diving tables for repetitive dives, surface decompression on air or oxygen for example. Since they understand parts of our industry; they really make it easier for a diving contractor to communicate with them.  Dave Scarberry has been their Diving Coordinator and the originator of their program since inception and is responsible for its development and administration.  Will Hux is the instructor from MESCO/ Stroud Diving & Hydrography and wrote the training curriculum for the classroom portion of the training.  They make a strong team in presenting a safety program of which is an industry first.

While it has been common industry practice to rely on hand written dive logs for divers and chamber runs for decompression, we have to rely completely on the integrity, quality, and capability of the human element to make detailed time and data entries without errors and while possibly being distracted by a great many things on deck.  Our company has been using electronic recorders and pressure sensors on chambers for years but now there exists a small device which we've been testing and have in practice for years which we issue to each diver and place in each of our chambers.  It records the time, depth, and temperature of the entire dive including the rates of ascent and descent.  They are a remarkable tool to counsel employees who violate descent and ascent rates or supervisors who allow surface intervals to go beyond the 5 minutes allowed between surfacing a diver and surface-decompression.

As a safety device, the recorders are completely indelible and the data is stored where it cannot be tampered with or changed.  They couple magnetically to upload data and there are no plugs or ports.  the only battery comes installed at the factory and they last approximately 10 years depending on usage.  These record chamber runs with precision and are completely intrinsic and sealed so there is no need to worry in an oxygen environment.  Testing is underway in our deep hyperbaric testing chamber to determine accuracy and integrity of its program and depth capability.

I hope to present this device and share the safe technology with all our members in January.

Originally presented at the Transportation Research Board in January 2011.  This paper discusses systems and techniques that have been utilized to restore the structural integrity and protect concrete, steel, and woodpiles for more than 35 years. Many bridges in active use today are well beyond their intended designed life.  Since it would be much too costly and time consuming to replace these bridges with new bridges, proven repair and rehabilitation systems are critical to the life and safety of these structures. This paper will discuss the use of the FX-70 Inert Corrosion Free fiberglass jacket system that utilizes FX-70-6 Hydro-Ester Multipurpose Marine Epoxy and FX-225 Underwater Mortar specifically designed for bridge pile restoration.

The US Supreme Court ruling in Atlantic Sounding v Townsend and the cases that have followed over the last two years have turned previously allowed employee damage remedies upside down. Punitive damages have been allowed not only in unseaworthiness claims, but in loss of consortium claims as well. In virtually all aspects of commercial diving and vessel operations , there has been a steady expansion of employee rights that every marine contractor and vessel operator need to understand and plan for.
Bringing you over three decades of diving risk management and analysis,  six time Superlawyer Rick Lesser will provide a summary of the most current aspects of diving and maritime law that will be invaluable in making  your own analysis of the risks and potential legal problems facing you., and more importantly, how to deal with them.

This subject will address a recent accident that occured to a diver while performing an underwater welding operation.  The resulting investigation and root cause analysis lead to the identification of several unrealized conditions that aided in creating this "perfect storm."  These included such items as unaccounted power sources, unfamiliar with tools, unknown actual amperage from welder, and adjacent work groups.  The end result was a new, and more detailed JHA was created that addresses these hazards.  This JHA includes all of the best safet practices as laid out by the ADCI, but also takes it to the next level of pre-job set ups, and a firm commitment by AEP on how all U/W buring and welding work will conducted across the entire fleet.
