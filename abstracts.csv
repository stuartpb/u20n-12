Advancements in Pipeline Inspection with AUVs,Advancements in Pipeline Inspection with AUVs - results from field trials of the HUGIN AUV and the HISAS Synthetic Aperture Sonar,"Hancock, Chris","Kongsberg Underwater Technologies, Inc.","HUGIN and REMUS AUVs use advanced feature recognition algorithms, developed originally for mine-detection, to track subsea pipelines directly in sonar data in real time. This, combined with sensors such as multibeam echo sounder and high-resolution still camera, enables inspection of pipelines at a considerably higher speed, and thus lower cost, than traditional methods, while producing higher quality data. Kongsberg Maritime’s unique way of performing pipeline inspection with AUV involves two fully-autonomous passes along a pipeline. The first pass is run off to the side, and by using either high-resolution interferometric synthetic aperture sonar (HISAS) or conventional side scan sonar (SSS), a wide swath around the pipeline is mapped as the AUV automatically tracks the pipeline directly from the sonar data. This way, the pipeline’s actual position is determined and knowledge is gained about surrounding threats like anchors and trawling activity in a wide swath of up more than 200 meters.
The second pass is run directly over the pipeline at a low altitude, and accurate inspection data is collected with multibeam echo sounder and camera. By using high-resolution still camera and mosaic techniques, one avoids the massive over-sampling resulting from use of video-cameras, which makes data management easier. The still camera pictures are automatically and accurately geo-referenced in the AUV, removing the need for the time-consuming task of matching up video with ROV positioning data. Another significant cost reduction stems from the elimination of the support vessel normally used in traditional pipeline inspection with ROV.
In cases where a priori data about the pipeline’s position is poor, and where the pipeline may be partially buried, this concept exploits the wide swath afforded by the HISAS by increasing tracking robustness and reducing the need for lateral search patterns to reacquire partially buried pipelines.
In the fall of 2011, Kongsberg Maritime has integrated automatic tracking of pipelines directly from the multibeam echo sounder data, thereby adding an important capability in the toolbox available to the AUV operator. In cases where it is appropriate, this can remove the need for the first survey pass, and gives the operator more flexibility in how to design the inspection mission. This paper highlights recent test results from industry-funded technology demonstration trials conducted along pipelines in the North Sea.",Submitted for Review,,MTS Member,Use this to have your track assigned by conference chair,Presentation,,,Update on the latest AUV technology for conducting autonomous pipeline inspection by presenting data from recent field trials,,"After graduating with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering from University of Vermont in 1978, Chris Hancock took a commission in the NOAA Corp (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) where he received his formal training as a hydrographic surveyor and conducted field operations in Washington State, Alaska and Hawaii.

Alternative CO2 Scrubber,An Alternative Method to Remove Carbon Dioxide From Submersible Environments,"Nuckols, Marshall",,"A major obstacle in the development of manned submersibles involves the removal of metabolically-produced carbon dioxide from the cabin environment, particularly during long-duration, cold water operations.  Traditional CO2 absorption methods utilized in underwater life support systems use alkali metal hydroxide chemical beds—mostly calcium hydroxide—which have been shown to have poor absorption efficiencies in cold environments.  Experimental evidence suggests that seawater, a readily accessible medium during submersible operations, could be a highly effective alternative scrubbing medium to remove metabolically-produced carbon dioxide.  Laboratory CO2 absorption trials are currently being conducted in a joint research effort between Duke University and the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, under sponsorship by the Office of Naval Research.  An overview of these absorption trials will be presented and the physical principles governing this absorption technique will be explained.   Alternative concept designs will be introduced and the suitability of these concepts for open and closed-circuit breathing systems will be discussed.",Submitted for Review,Contributed,MTS Member,Manned Underwater Vehicles,Presentation,None required.,,Review progress in the development of an alternative carbon dioxide absorption technology for underwater life support.,,"Dr. Nuckols joined the faculty at Duke University as Senior Research Scientist in October of 2004.

Data Logger For Surface And/Or Subsea,HOW TO AID YOUR OPERATIONS IN REDUCING FAILURES,"Payan, Raquel",The Subsea Company,"HOW TO AID YOUR OPERATIONS IN REDUCING FAILURES

Richard Davidson and Eric Milne, The Subsea Company

The Surface or Subsea Data Logger is intended to give operators the ability to monitor key pressures and provide information in real-time.

The Subsea Company offers 2 types of Data Loggers:
1)	Surface Data Logger
2)	Subsea Data Logger

The Data Logger is specifically designed to capture pressure (P) vs. a set time (T) on a chart recorder or data-logger at high resolution. The test equipment is connected between a hydraulic supply and the equipment to be tested. While operating the equipment, pressure vs. time is recorded on a suitably scaled chart recorder or data-logger. The newly captured chart is compared against known good data. The performance curves are then interpreted to determine if the equipment is operating within an acceptable range. With the Data Logger information, one can determine if the equipment is operating as designed.

As for the Subsea Data Logger, equipment to record pressures and other data on the BOP Stack while subsea is independent of existing control pods and the data is accessible on the surface. The Subsea Data Logger units can be daisy-chained and placed on the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) and/or lower stack. The Data Logger's battery power source is good for long durations without a recharge. These batteries can be recharged subsea via ROV.  The data is multi-plexed onto a single mode fiber. The on board computer records data from up to 8 analog channels concurrently at a high data rate (up to 250,000 X 8 samples per second). ROV interface is provided for separate communications path to the unit.

Typical use for the Data Logger for Surface and/or Subsea:
o	Factory acceptance testing of RAM BOPs, annulars, connectors, valves, BOP stacks and trees
o	On-hire acceptance testing of production and offshore drilling rigs
o	Pre-deployment testing of trees and BOP stacks following repairs and maintenance
o	Before and after maintenance
o	To justify an extended maintenance period

Our proprietary Data Logger for Surface and/or Subsea will aid your operations in reducing failures. The Data Logger will also give the ability to be proactive with regards to possible government regulations.",Under Review,,MTS Member,Engineering Topics Not Covered by Other Tracks,Extended,,,,,,Other

Early leak detection,Hydrocarbon Sniffers In Mobile Subsea Flowline Monitoring - A Field Report,"Esser, Daniel",Contros Systems & Solutions GmbH,"Exploration and production activities for oil and gas are steadily increasing in subsea areas. Various methods exist to detect and localize subsea oil and gas emissions but there is still a lack of understanding the processes of subsea leakages, and technologies to detect and localize emissions from subsea installations at an early stage have to be improved. Detecting and localizing subsea oil and gas emissions means dealing with warm multiphase outflow consisting of oil phase, gas bubbles and dissolved gas (mainly Methane), formation water, mixing with cold seawater, and sometimes even the formation of additional solid gas hydrate phases. Recent field observations and hydrodynamic models of Methane-rich fluid transport at natural seeping sites indicate the distinct behavior of Methane-dominated fluids in seawater.
A successful leak detection strategy must focus on the different physicochemical fluid characteristics of Methane as a tracer for subsea oil and gas emissions in general. The feasibility of Hydrocarbon Sniffers for the detection, localization and subsequent validation of subsea oil and gas emissions has been proven in several ROV- and AUV-borne subsea flowline surveys from 2008 until today.

Electronic Recording Diving & Chamber Dives,Electronic Recording of Diving & Chamber Dives,"Hux, Will F.",MESCO/ Stroud Diving & Hydrography,"While it has been common industry practice to rely on hand written dive logs for divers and chamber runs for decompression, we have to rely completely on the integrity, quality, and capability of the human element to make detailed time and data entries without errors and while possibly being distracted by a great many things on deck.  Our company has been using electronic recorders and pressure sensors on chambers for years but now there exists a small device which we've been testing and have in practice for years which we issue to each diver and place in each of our chambers.  It records the time, depth, and temperature of the entire dive including the rates of ascent and descent.  They are a remarkable tool to counsel employees who violate descent and ascent rates or supervisors who allow surface intervals to go beyond the 5 minutes allowed between surfacing a diver and surface-decompression.

As a safety device, the recorders are completely indelible and the data is stored where it cannot be tampered with or changed.  They couple magnetically to upload data and there are no plugs or ports.  the only battery comes installed at the factory and they last approximately 10 years depending on usage.  These record chamber runs with precision and are completely intrinsic and sealed so there is no need to worry in an oxygen environment.

Environmental Monitoring with AUVs,Environmental Monitoring with AUVs - New sensors and techniques for detection and assessment of hydrocarbons in deep water,"Hancock, Chris","Kongsberg Underwater Technologies, Inc.","AUVs are ideal platforms for carrying an array of sensors for monitoring the environment around offshore installations. Combined with subsea docking technology, AUVs equipped with environmental sensors provide a persistent early warning capability against oil and gas leaks from drilling operations and pipelines, or other environmental contaminants. Acoustics is emerging as an alternative method of indirectly (or directly) detecting hydrocarbons in the water column. Kongsberg sonars are at the forefront of this developing technology which has also been adapted for AUV application. Its fisheries echo sounders have been used extensively in recent years for detecting and tracking oil plumes resulting from subsea leaks.
Kongsberg’s AUVs combine the latest in sonar technology, hydrocarbon sensors (“sniffers”) and other chemical sensors to provide a full suite of environmental sensors on a long endurance, autonomous and low-logistics subsea platform. Our host of in-house AUV technologies enables a reliable and capable environmental monitoring and warning tool and includes subsea docking, through-moonpool launch and recovery, platform hovering and adaptive behaviors.

While initially more expensive, these fluids can save money and time when properly utilized. They can improve equipment performance, while protecting the user from costly fines and clean up in the event of a leak or spill.

Environmentally safe lubricants will be presented from a 'hands-on' perspective. The paper will review spills and response regulations. It will also cover major organizational and commercial initiatives that are the major driving forces behind their use.

The paper will explore the types of biodegradable products and how they interact with underwater equipment. Included will be their compatibility with hydraulics, pumps, sealing materials, hoses, and other important components. Water infiltration, high pressure, wide temperature range usage as well as ways to manage these challenges will also be discussed.

There will be a discussion of specific maintenance practices that are required to maintain long useful life of these fluids as well as long equipment life. This will include real world experience gained by several successful long term field demonstrations with commercial and military divers and ROVs.

Generating 3D Models from Underwater Video,Generating Photorealistic 3D Models from Underwater Inspection Video,"Cavan, Neil",2G Robotics Inc.,"Video inspection by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) is simple, cost effective to deploy, and widely used. However, this inspection method suffers from the limitations of underwater visibility. Since it is only possible to observe a small section of an underwater asset at any one time, long videos are necessary to fully inspect large assets. The information provided by inspection videos is valuable, but it can be time-consuming to assess the state of an underwater asset based on many hours of video.

This presentation demonstrates a software tool developed by 2G Robotics for generating photorealistic 3D models from underwater video. Computer identified feature points in the video are automatically tracked, and are then reconstructed as a digital 3D point cloud of the asset observed in the video. Once the point cloud has been obtained, it can be surfaced and coloured using image data from the video to create a photorealistic 3D model of the entire asset. The algorithms can work with video from any camera, and need only the video itself as input: no special calibration object or motion sequence is used. Since no change to the inspection workflow is required, this technology can create a 3D model from archived inspection video.

Using a photorealistic 3D model as the starting point for underwater asset inspection allows the state of the entire asset to be understood more quickly and intuitively compared to using video alone.  This technology has the potential to alter the post inspection work-flow, saving time and providing greater asset understanding, resulting in reduced project costs and risks.",,Contributed,not MTS Member,Instruments and Sensors,Presentation,,,,,,Cameras for ROV or Diver Applications

Mathematical Machines & Systems, National Academy of Sciences","The world ocean remains the last unexplored space on earth. Underwater robots, when massively deployed, can bring huge benefit. Their use, however, is much more complicated than aerial or ground ones, due to communication problems. That is why enhancing intelligence of individual robots for increasing autonomy and reducing communications is the primary goal. In this paper we are offering a high-level distributed control technology that can dynamically integrate any underwater units into operable teams with a sort of global consciousness and pursuing global goals. It is based on universal knowledge processing and control modules easily installed in units and communicating with each other via any available channels. Ad hoc networks of these modules spatially, in parallel, interpret global mission descriptions in a special high-level Distributed Scenario Language (DSL) reflecting top semantics of what to be done in a distributed maritime space, while leaving system structuring and task-oriented C2 entirely to automatic language interpretation.  Extremely  short, created on the fly, DSL scenarios are injected into the robotic swarm from any unit, subsequently covering the whole system and setting the needed behavior, with communications between vehicles much shorter than with any other approaches (thus suitable for low speed channels). Implementation details of the technology will be revealed, and exemplary scenarios in DSL related to underwater environments, like collective distributed search of a large territory for specific objects or patrolling coastline will be shown.

The new trends are low logistics, highly maneuverable systems in addition rated up to 300m. The manufacturers always offer information about forward/backward/vertical/lateral speed of their ROV in ideal near surface conditions more rarely about thruster performance, but the real question of the operator is often about  the possibility of  survey the particular  bottom area in particular(preferably near maximum vehicle rating) depth in particular time under various but real sea conditions. Regardless of ROV mission type the operational challenges caused by the tether drag arise at 300m depths. One of the key features of observation ROVs is accessible bottom or structure survey area from fixed topside. The next is the ROV speed at underwater site which form the survey coverage rate.

A list of continuously available normal and fault status for a module is described.  A consol display of this operational status for all 64 modules and of the overall system is provided.
	Both standard and state-of-the-art advances for operation, maintenance, and safety of the battery system will be described.  Significant among the state-of-the-art advances are:

1)  A fast, safe, & automatic, module balancing method for supporting module replacement that is typically 100X faster than conventional methods;
2)  Two means for determining module State Of Health;
3)  An innovative means for timely detection of internal shorts within any cell in the battery system; and
4)  Ability to extend battery life and improve safety by automatically adjusting the charge level of all the modules within the battery system.

MATE ROV Competition,Think of Yourselves as Entrepreneurs - How the MATE ROV Competition is challenging students to develop 21st century workplace skills,"Zande, Jill",Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center,"For 10 years, the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center’s international ROV competition program has challenged students to think creatively, work as part of a team, and apply technical skills in new and innovative ways.

However, in 2011 the Center took a new approach to encouraging students to develop 21st century workplace skills.  Instead of teams, MATE asked students to think of themselves as entrepreneurs and to form “companies” instead of “teams.”  We challenged them to develop an understanding of the breadth of business operations and to structure their company with the appropriate personnel – from CEOs to CFOs, Software Engineers to Marketing Directors,  Operations Managers to PR Specialists.  Not only were they expected to design, build, and perform, their “product,” they also had to sell it to their client – in this case, the MATE Center and the industry professionals who volunteer as competition judges.

The response was positive – and powerful!  Students and mentors took the challenge very seriously.  They came up with creative names for their companies and, in some cases, developed a company logo.  They identified the positions necessary for a business to run successfully and assigned students to those roles.  They created business cards and marketing materials that described their company and product line.  (One company developed an “app” that is available for download on the iTunes store.)  They wore suits and ties during their engineering presentations.  They gave cost and delivery estimates for their product and, if they had competed before, their record of past performance.

Based on this success, the MATE competition will continue its entrepreneurial approach and add to it in 2012.  For example, in order to reach out to and further engage students with an interest in technology but an aptitude in the arts, MATE will ask companies to develop PR “kits” and put them into practice by targeting their local media.",Accptd pnding mat'l,Invited,MTS Member,Education and Academic Presentations,Presentation,,,"Jill Zande is the Associate Director and ROV Competition Coordinator for the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center and the current VP of Education and Research for MTS.

Micro-ROV as Enablers in Education,Micro-ROV as Enablers in Education,"Goldstein, Andrew",VideoRay,"Robotics plays an increasing role in STEM education.   It provides for a systems level curricula which encompasses and integrates many disciplines:  mathematics, mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, and domain specific problem solving.     Adding the aspect of underwater exploration to the story makes the use of robotics even more compelling as a driver of improvements to STEM education.  The unique scientific component of underwater exploration allows for the combination of non-engineering scientific elements such biology, geology, oceanography and even archeology.
The commercial micro ROV provides benefits as an educational tool.   The primary benefits being ease of use and logistics, relative low cost, multiplicity of roles, and system completeness.   The microROV also enables a continuum of development which synchronizes well with other popular STEM efforts.
This talk will discuss some of the ways in which VideoRay fosters undersea robotics in educational roles.

Missing Cave Diver Search,"1,300 ROV Penitration at Vortex Springs Florida","Lapinsky, Sam",Innovative Dive Equipment,"Our agency was contacted by the Holmes County Sheriff’s Office after all other efforts failed to locate the remains of a cave diver who reportedly failed to return to the surface after a deep cave penetration dive into Vortex Springs.
   Before we left to assist with our Pro 4 ROV we were told that the missing diver was believed to be deep in the cave (approx 1,400 feet), in an area where the diameter of the tube where the diver was thought to be was equal to the size of the diver. Before our arrival experienced cave divers had searched the inside of the cave, and penetrated approx 1,200 feet into the cave. It was hoped that the ROV could reach an additional 200 feet, which was the limit of the mapped system. This area of the cave was not much larger that the ROV itself, and the ROV, or any diver reaching this point would not be able to turn around to exit the cave.
   Unfortunately we were not able to locate the lost diver, but this presentation will review the challenges we encountered using an ROV in these most difficult circumstances, in a rarely attempted type of search and recovery mission.

The first one of these was began in 1989 and named C-BUG (Controlled by Buoyancy Underwater Glider). It was one of the first winged subs ever made and enjoyed a successful career spanning over 550 dives in three countries. The next vehicle was named Idabel, and despite an initial budget of under 100k it has made over 900 dives to depths of up to half a mile.   In addition to keeping manufacturing costs low, operating costs have been kept low as well by a location choice that offers immediate access to deep water without the need for a support craft of any sort. A third aspect to the low operating costs has been the engineering of Idabel for minimum displacement. This craft carries two passengers and a pilot and weighs in at just over 9,000 pounds, making it not only less expensive to build and operate, but giving it a distinct advantage for photography. This formula has resulted in dive rates that start at just $400 per person for a 1000 foot dive, and a day rate of $2,000 for up to 6 hour-long dives.",Submitted for Review,,MTS Member,Manned Underwater Vehicles,Presentation,,,,,,Manned Sub Operations & Projects

Abstract for UI-2012

RHOV PERSONNEL SPHERE UPDATE - THE END IS IN SIGHT

Southwest Research Institute® (SwRI®) is under contract to WHOI to design, fabricate and test the titanium personnel sphere that will be installed in the upgraded ALVIN submersible. SwRI is nearing completion of the fabrication and testing phases for the new personnel sphere. The personnel sphere will be tested in the Annapolis Test Chambers for a 6500 MSW maximum operating depth. The fabrication and testing had been expected to be completed but the decision to have the personnel sphere dual certified by both ABS and NAVSEA has resulted in schedule delays. All major weldments and the final machining of all components have been completed without experiencing any appreciable distortion or change in out-of-sphericity. Component assembly and structural validation tests are in progress. Stud welding procedures for the viewport windows and the hatch have been developed and are being employed.  A strain gauge location plan is being developed based upon an as-built dimensional FEA model and analysis. A comprehensive hydrostatic test procedure is being developed and going through the dual approval process leading up to the hydro test in the Spring of 2012.  SwRI will deliver the sphere and documentation to WHOI after the hydro test to complete our contract. The status and activities since last year and activities to complete the personnel sphere in 2012 will be discussed

ROV Dredging Using Advanced Techniques,ROV Dredging Using Advanced Techniques,"Kros, Hans",Oceaneering Intl.,"Trends in underwater salvage and excavation markets indicate improved access
to remote areas and complex dredging methods are more available to subsea
operators than previously.

Deepwater and ultra-deepwater decommissioning and salvage efforts have
forged alternatives to standard vertical access and mass excavation
techniques. For structural removal, horizontal penetration is possible
beyond normal vertical dredge pumping. Hydraulically driven dredge pumps
placed on the sea bed and connected with long-length hydraulic hoses deliver
power from host vessels on the surface.

Advanced imaging equipment can penetrate fixed structures in zero visibility
conditions. This allows more precise ROV manipulation of excavation tooling.
Combined with real-time ROV positioning, these imaging tools enable the ROV
to navigate with""acoustic"" cameras.

Modern subsea field developments have tighter templates with more densely
located subsea assets. When excavating these templates, horizontal
transportation of the spoils prevents other asset areas from potential
burial.

Drill cuttings often deposit around wellheads during drilling operations.
ROVs equipped with dredging hardware can disperse the drill cuttings to
desirable areas in the adjacent vicinity, keeping wellheads clear and even

ROV Repair in less than 60 Minutes,ROV Repair and Return to Work in 60 Minutes or Less,"Porterfield, Andy",Schilling Robotics,"In response to the complexity of the missions they are asked to perform, ROVs continue to become more powerful and complicated in design.  When a component fails, repair tasks can take multiple hours and have a significant economic impact on ROV operators and their customers.  In all instances of major ROV subsystem repairs, the component that needs to be replaced or repaired is located in the second or third tier of the design; gaining access to and repairing the failed component can require multiple hours of work.  For example, a HPU replacement on a conventional ROV can typically take 8 hours.  With an average pipelay vessel day rate of $180,000, the vessel downtime cost of such a task can easily mount to $60,000 or more.

An assessment of this issue showed that it was not feasible to achieve step-change improvements in repair tasks without revisiting the overall system design philosophy and placing a significant focus on the primary challenges of time to repair and ability to perform the repair correctly the first time.  As a result, Schilling Robotics has invested in developing ROV technology that can be repaired within 60 minutes, providing a significant increase in ROV system uptime and customer profitability.

This presentation will review features important in reducing downtime including: modular subsystem design, component accessibility, ease of replacement, and removal of the potential for installation errors during the maintenance process.

Through-the-sensor Multibeam control of ROVs,"Multibeam Imaging Sonar-Track, through-the-sensor control for microROVs","Tena, Ioseba",SeeByte,"Multibeam imaging sonars have been available since the early nineties and have served well as a tool to improve situational awareness. Operators can observe targets at distances of tens to hundreds of yards and use the information to navigate underwater vehicles and monitor important subsea regions. The original systems were significant in size and weight and required large electronic pods to beam form and process the raw data. But today’s multibeam imaging sonars are of a size suitable for microROV operation, so much so that they have become a common payload option for many operators. In tandem software solutions enabling close control of unmanned systems using through-the-sensor servoing techniques have evolved to a level of maturity suitable for commercial exploitation. The bringing together of this technology with the microROV will enable a new level of user control to the operational users. A common task such as flying to a target can be a difficult undertaking when faced with currents and tether effects, when time is at a premium this can be frustrating and negatively impact the overall mission needs. This proposed technology enables the microROV to keep station relative to an object or structure identified in the sonar data. The ROV can then maneuver relative to this object and the pilot need only provide simple point-and-click commands on the sonar screen. This talk will illustrate some early results on early prototype work.",,Contributed,not MTS Member,Instruments and Sensors,Presentation,,,,,"Andy Goldstein, VideoRay

Under Ice Operations Using a Micro-ROV,Under Ice Operations Using a Micro-ROV,"Wrasse, Thomas",,"While underwater operations provide a host of significant anxieties, when a sheet of ice is added to the picture the pressure increases similar to a diver descending down the water column.  Past practice - putting human life in jeopardy by traversing unsafe ice conditions or by placing divers into a confined space is no longer advisable.  Micro-ROV technology allows first responders to locate, inspect, and retrieve rapidly, efficiently, safely, and cost-effectively.  The requirement of cutting large holes for under ice diving creates future public hazards until solid freeze up occurs.   The extremely small hole required of the Micro-ROV minimizes vulnerability and can easily be made safe upon completion of the task.
The Micro-ROV is easily deployed, with minimal risk, into a potential human trap eliminating travel to the unknown.  The Micro-ROV can without difficulty, assess hazards, survey the scene, locate and identify targets, recover evidence and provide a safe lane of travel for a diver.
